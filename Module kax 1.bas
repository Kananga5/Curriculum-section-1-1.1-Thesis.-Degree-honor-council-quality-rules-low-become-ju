?? Integration Ideas
You can expand this code to:
"   Log status in a worksheet or database
"   Trigger alerts for failed imports
"   Link to credential mapping or curriculum modules
"   Route to GitHub pages using FollowHyperlink
Would you like help building a full dashboard that links these repositories to your Visual Basic forms, Eaton documentation, or institutional workflows? I can also help you automate retry logic for failed imports.

This project was part of an an employment application to Uturn Data Solutions to test infrastructure skills. They provided a pre-coded AWS DynamoDB and Python based API application that was to be pulled and stood up to run on cloud infrastructure. I utilized AWS, OpenTofu (a fork of Terraform), and GitLab CI. There are two web servers behind a load balancer for redundancy.

?? Visual Basic Integration Idea
You can build a GitHub Project Navigator in VBA that lets you:
"   Select a category (e.g., "Engineering", "Blockchain", "Education")
"   View a list of related repositories
"   Open the GitHub page directly
"   Log access for audit or credential tracking
Sample VBA Snippet
Sub OpenGitHubProject()
    Dim Category As String
    Category = InputBox("Enter category (e.g., Engineering, Blockchain, Education):")

    Select Case LCase(Category)
        Case "engineering"
            Call OpenURL("https://github.com/Kananga5/engineering-workbaseexperimental-tshingombe-magazine-triggered")

        Case "blockchain"
            Call OpenURL("https://github.com/Kananga5/bitcoin")

        Case "education"
            Call OpenURL("https://github.com/Kananga5/education-technologe-saqa-result")

        Case Else
            MsgBox "Category not recognized. Try Engineering, Blockchain, or Education.", vbExclamation
    End Select
End Sub

Sub OpenURL(url As String)
    ThisWorkbook.FollowHyperlink Address:=url, NewWindow:=True
End Sub
Would you like me to help you build a full VBA dashboard that links all your GitHub repositories to your credential-linked modules, audit logs, or didactic panel templates?

?? Integration Ideas
You can extend this code to:
"   Link to credential mapping modules (e.g., Call MapCredential("Cybersecurity"))
"   Trigger bilingual export logic (e.g., Call ExportToFrench("Installation"))
"   Log audit traceability (e.g., Call LogAccess("Manual"))
"   Embed into a dashboard for modular document access
I can help you build a full VBA interface or export matrix that links this logic to your Eaton, Schneider, and ASCO documentation. Just let me know which category or module you'd like to automate next.

?? How You Can Use This
"   Embed this into a macro-enabled Excel workbook or Access form
"   Expand the Select Case block with more documents from your list
"   Link this logic to credential mapping, audit traceability, or bilingual export workflows
I can help you build a full VBA dashboard that routes to certification documents, technical manuals, and product guides across Eaton, Schneider, and ASCO systems. Just let me know which category you'd like to automate next.

## GitLab CI

This project 's static Pages are built by [GitLab CI][ci], following the steps
defined in [`.gitlab-ci.yml`](.gitlab-ci.yml):

```
image: busybox

pages:
stage:   deploy
script:
  - echo 'Nothing to do...'
artifacts:
paths:
    - public
    expire_in: 1 day
rules:
    - if: $CI_COMMIT_REF_NAME == $CI_DEFAULT_BRANCH
```

The above example expects to put all your HTML files in the `public/` directory.

## GitLab User or Group Pages

To use this project as your user/group website, you will need one additional
step: just rename your project to `namespace.gitlab.io`, where `namespace` is
your `username` or `groupname`. This can be done by navigating to your
project 's **Settings**.

Read more about [user/group Pages][userpages] and [project Pages][projpages].

## Did you fork this project?

If you forked this project for your own use, please go to your project's
**Settings** and remove the forking relationship, which won't be necessary
unless you want to contribute back to the upstream project.

## Troubleshooting

1. CSS is missing! That means that you have wrongly set up the CSS URL in your
   HTML files. Have a look at the [index.html] for an example.

Thanks for sharing this rich extract from SAQA's Annual Report 2024/25. Here's a structured synthesis tailored to your credential-linked, modular framework development goals:
?? Strategic Themes from SAQA's 2024/25 Annual Report
1. ?? Policy Review and Implementation
SAQA reviewed and amended five core NQF policies:
"   Foreign Qualification Evaluation
"   Registration of Qualifications and Part-Qualifications
"   Recognition of Professional Bodies and Designations
"   Credit Accumulation and Transfer (CAT)
"   Level Descriptors for the NQF
?? Implementation was tracked through SAQA-QC engagements and a formal implementation report.
2. ?? Continental Alignment and Mobility
"   ACQF Referencing: SAQA led South Africa's referencing of the NQF to the African Continental Qualifications Framework (ACQF), forming a national reference team and producing a report due in 2025.
"   Addis Convention: SAQA advanced implementation through foreign qualification evaluations and policy development on partial studies and microcredentials.
3. ?? NLRD Expansion and Data Integrity
"   24.5 million learner achievements are now reflected on the NLRD.
"   SAQA is digitising legacy datasets and filling gaps via direct institutional engagement.
"   As of Feb 2025, 68% of verification requests were fulfilled, with a project plan underway to improve this.
4. ?? Articulation and Professional Designation Trust
"   All post-2014 qualifications on the NQF must have at least one articulation pathway.
"   SAQA identified gaps and requested updates from QCs.
"   A new SAQA Professional Body Model was approved to clarify roles and support designation registration.
5. ?? Organisational Development and Staff Learning
"   SAQA redesigned its structure with external evaluation support.
"   Every staff member completed at least two learning interventions per year, meeting the 5-year target.
6. ?? System Efficiency and Stakeholder Alignment
"   Landing pages were created for QCTO and Umalusi to submit qualifications.
"   CHE is developing a system to integrate with SAQA's services.
"   SAQA supports professional bodies in uploading designation data to the NLRD, with training and de-registration measures where needed.
?? Application to Your Modular Frameworks
This report offers a blueprint for:
"   Mapping policy revisions into credential-linked logigrams and export tables.
"   Tracking articulation pathways and professional body roles for didactic panel integration.
"   Embedding NLRD verification logic into your Visual Basic modules and dashboard systems.
"   Aligning with ACQF and Addis Convention for cross-border recognition and microcredential scaffolding.
Would you like me to help scaffold a bilingual dashboard or logigram that reflects these policy updates and performance targets?
Print Key; Compliance And Assurance; Highlights
"   The report is declared complete and accurate.
"   Financial statements are prepared per prescribed standards.
"   External auditors provided an independent opinion.
"   Reasonable assurance is given on the integrity of performance and HR information.
?? Relevance to Your Work
Given your role in curriculum architecture and credential-linked frameworks, this report is a valuable reference for:
"   Audit-aligned reporting structures for modular frameworks.
"   Governance and compliance templates that can be adapted for institutional dashboards.
"   Performance tracking aligned with NQF outcomes and 5-year targets.
"   Credential-linked HR and programme performance indicators for didactic panel integration.
Would you like me to help you extract or reformat specific sections-like the Strategic Overview, Programme Performance, or PFMA Compliance-for integration into your modular dashboards or credential-linked templates?

?? Supplier Registration Summary - Department of Higher Education and Training (DHET)
?? Purpose
To register suppliers on DHET's approved database in compliance with the Public Finance Management Act (PFMA) and Accounting Officers Procurement Procedures (AOPP), ensuring equal opportunity and efficient procurement.
?? Key Registration Requirements
"   Mandatory Documents:
o   Company registration certificate
o   Tax clearance certificate
o   VAT certificate (if applicable)
o   ID copies of directors
o   Accreditation certificates
o   Cancelled cheque or bank verification letter
o   Company profile (max 2 pages)
"   Form Completion Rules:
o   All fields must be completed in black ink
o   No faxed or unsigned forms accepted
o   Changes must be reported within 14 days
o   False information or fronting leads to blacklisting
?? Supplier Classification
"   Business Type: Sole Proprietor, Partnership, CC, Pty Ltd, Trust, Section 21, Consortium, Joint Venture
"   SMME Status: Micro, Very Small, Small, Medium, Large
"   Sector: Engineering, Education, Construction, ICT, Professional Services, etc.
"   Ownership: HDI, Women Equity, Disability status declared
?? Management System Information
"   Database Updates: Quarterly, with summary verification
"   Conflict of Interest Declaration: Required for all owners/directors
"   Verification: DHET reserves the right to inspect premises
"   Communication: Must include operating fax number for updates
?? Core Business and Commodity Registration
"   Suppliers must define:
o   Core Business (e.g., engineering education, technical documentation, mentoring)
o   Trade Names (if sole distributor)
o   Commodities (from construction, services, professional, or wholesale categories)
?? Legal and Compliance Notes
"   Insolvent applicants must provide rehabilitation proof
"   Blacklisted entities must be cleared before registration
"   Registration does not guarantee contract award
"   Misrepresentation may lead to deregistration and legal action
?? Integration Potential for Your Framework
This registration logic can be modularized into:
"   Visual Basic logigram: mapping supplier compliance steps to PFMA audit sheets
"   Algorigram: tracking document submission, verification, and approval flow
"   Credential-linked export tables: for supplier classification, SMME status, and commodity mapping
"   Bilingual dashboards: for public service readiness and institutional traceability
"   Absolutely, Tshingombe. Here's a tailored Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) module that scaffolds a logigram-style dashboard for tracking supplier registration and compliance verification aligned with PFMA and DHET protocols.

You 've compiled an impressive and extensive library of Visual Basic modules, UserForms, class files, and didactic documentation-clearly reflecting your commitment to modular credential-linked systems, autopedagogie, and trade education integration. Here's how we can scaffold and synthesize this into a structured logigram/algorigram framework for automation, credential export, and audit traceability:
?? Logigram & Algorigram Automation Framework (Visual Basic)
?? Core Modules & Classes
These form the backbone of your credential-linked logic:
Component Purpose
Class1_total_career_aiu_eato_scheinder_alison_saqa_rnf_total_programm_form_combie.cls   Central career logic class for credential mapping
Module_total_kfrm1t0_kfrm40_k1_to_total_subject_learning.bas    Subject learning flow and milestone tracking
Module6_9009999_autodidactic_drawin_copilote_assess_assign_total_career.bas Autodidactic drawing and assessment logic
Module992.bas, Module991.bas    Credential export and audit sheet generation
Module5_900000_assessment.bas   Trade and education assessment logic
Module_k1.bas to Module_k6.cls  Sequential algorigram logic for modular flow
?? UserForms for Credential-Linked Interaction
These support user input, registration, and career mapping:

?? UserForms for Credential-Linked Interaction
These support user input, registration, and career mapping:
UserForm    Function
UserForm_190000002_integrator_artificial_module_career_and_training.frm AI-integrated career and training module
UserForm7_tshingombe.frm    Personalized registration and didactic panel
UserForm90000_inventory.frm Inventory and panel traceability

UserForm_trade_certificate_sttemnt.frm  Trade certificate and statement logic
UserForm_license_algorith_protect.frm   Licensing and algorithm protection
?? Logigram/Algorigram Logic Flow
You can structure your automation like this:

    Dim careerPath As String
    Dim assessmentScore As Integer
    Dim exportReady As Boolean

    ' Load career logic
    Set careerPath = LoadCareerPath("Class1_total_career_aiu_eato_scheinder_alison_saqa_rnf_total_programm_form_combie.cls")

    ' Run autodidactic assessment
    assessmentScore = RunAssessment("Module6_9009999_autodidactic_drawin_copilote_assess_assign_total_career.bas")

    ' Check if export conditions are met
    exportReady = CheckExportReadiness(assessmentScore)

    If exportReady Then
        Call GenerateAuditSheet("Module992.bas")
        MsgBox "Credential-linked audit sheet generated successfully."
    Else
        MsgBox "Assessment incomplete. Please review learning modules."
    End If
End Sub
?? Integration with Didactic Panels & Trade Theory
Your .docx and .pdf files (e.g., careeer_20_drawig_material_didactic_autopedagogie_panel_teach.docx) can be modularized into:
"   Panel-based learning outcomes
"   Trade theory validation
"   CPD and NATED framework alignment
"   Portfolio evidence for SAQA, AIU, Eaton, Schneider, Alison
?? Next Steps
I can help you:
"   Scaffold a bilingual export-ready dashboard using these modules
"   Automate milestone tracking and credential validation
"   Link UserForms to dynamic logigram/algorigram flows
"   Modularize legal compliance and trade test logic
Just let me know which module or UserForm you'd like to activate

?? Career Scope & Job Roles
"   Career scope defines the range of opportunities available within a field, shaped by qualifications, experience, and evolving industry needs.
"   Job roles are specific positions with defined duties, often aligned to institutional frameworks like those at DUT, where roles span academic, administrative, technical, and research domains.
?? Psychometric Evaluation
"   Purpose: Measures cognitive abilities, personality traits, values, and aptitudes to guide career decisions and recruitment.
"   Application:
o   Career guidance: Helps students choose subjects and career paths aligned with their strengths
"  .
"  Recruitment: Offers objective data to reduce bias and improve hiring decisions
"  .
"  Performance prediction: Assesses traits linked to workplace success, such as resilience, teamwork, and leadership
"
o   .
?? Career Performance & Recruitment
"   Performance tracking: Involves KPIs, feedback systems, and developmental reviews to monitor growth and readiness for promotion or reassignment.
"   Recruitment:
o   Uses psychometric tools to ensure fair, data-driven selection.
o   Aligns candidate traits with job requirements, especially in multidisciplinary environments like DUT
"
o   .
?? Experimental Student Record & Assessment
"   Experimental records: Capture non-traditional learning outcomes, such as project-based work, simulations, or panel evaluations.
"   Assessment types:
o   Formative: Ongoing feedback to guide learning.
o   Summative: Final evaluations for certification or progression.
o   Diagnostic: Identifies learning gaps or strengths.
"   Role in career development: Supports credential-linked progression and readiness for trade tests or public service deployment.
??? DUT Post Roles & Institutional Alignment
"   DUT roles may include:
o   Lecturer/Researcher: Focused on curriculum delivery and innovation.
o   Technician/Panel Facilitator: Supports practical training and assessment.
o   Administrator/Compliance Officer: Manages records, audits, and institutional reporting.
"   These roles often require modular documentation, panel-based evaluation, and alignment with SAQA/DHET standards, which you already specialize in.
Would you like me to map these components into a modular logigram or credential-linked framework for DUT or another institution?

Career psychometrics and job analytics combine statistical evaluation, recruitment metrics, and didactic portfolio tracking to optimize learning, placement, and labour reconciliation.
Here 's a structured breakdown of your multifaceted framework, integrating psychometric, statistical, and didactic dimensions:
?? Psychometric Calculation & Recruitment Goals
"   Psychometric tools assess cognitive ability, personality, abstract reasoning, and learning potential
"   .
"   Recruitment goals align psychometric profiles with job classes (junior, senior, cadet) to ensure role fit and career progression.
"   Job duty averages are derived from performance benchmarks and psychometric alignment.
?? Statistical Metrics for Career Analysis
"   Mean & variance: Used to calculate average performance, salary distribution, and recruitment success rates.
"   Job class frequency: Tracks how often roles are posted or filled, aiding workforce planning.
"   Loss accumulation: Measures salary gaps, missed opportunities, and benefit forfeiture due to non-placement or regret scenarios.
?? Portfolio Submission & Didactic Value
"   Career portfolios include:
o   Psychometric scores
o   Learning achievements (e.g., LMS completions)
o   Trade test results
o   Panel-based evaluations
"   Didactic value: Quantifies readiness for real job deployment, using modular frameworks and autopedagogie principles.
?? Job Simulation, Demo, and Real-World Testing
"   Demo jobs simulate tasks for training and psychometric calibration.
"   Real jobs validate learning outcomes through performance audits and trade test panels.
"   Trading function analysis: Applies statistical testing to job performance, especially in technical or economic roles.
?? Career Levels, Awards & Awareness
"   Junior/Senior/Cadet roles are mapped to psychometric thresholds and experiential milestones.
"   Awards recognize cognitive, theoretical, and practical excellence.
"   Awareness metrics track readiness, adaptability, and abstract reasoning.
?? Labour Conciliation & Ruling Integration
"   Labour rulings and conciliation outcomes are integrated into career analytics to:
o   Track dispute resolution
o   Align job duties with legal frameworks
o   Inform psychometric and performance recalibration
Would you like me to generate a logigram or VBA module that calculates job class frequency, psychometric variance, and portfolio value for trade test readiness?

?? Purpose of the Study
"   To assess individual differences in cognitive control using four classic tasks:
o Stroop
o AX - CPT
o   Task Switching
o Sternberg
"   To evaluate psychometric reliability (split-half and test-retest) across baseline, proactive, and reactive sessions.
?? Methodological Highlights
1. Data Cleaning & Trial Exclusion
"   Reaction times (RTs) >3 SDs above the mean were excluded.
"   Error rate cutoffs (e.g., 40%) were used to remove outliers.
"   Subjects with excessive trial loss were excluded from specific task analyses.
2. Reliability Estimation
"   Traditional methods:
o   Split-half reliability via 5000 permutations + Spearman-Brown correction.
o   Test-retest reliability using ICC(2,1) and ICC(3,1) (absolute agreement vs. consistency).
"   Hierarchical Bayesian Modeling (HBM):
o   Modeled RT distributions as lognormal, accounting for:
"   Subject-level variability
"   Trial-by-trial variance
"   Skewness in RT distributions
o   Provided generative estimates of test-retest reliability.
?? Key Findings
Task    RT Trials Removed   Subjects Removed    Error Rate Cutoff
Stroop  1.7%    1   40%
AX-CPT  2.9%    10  40%
Task Switching  1.5%    2   40%
Sternberg   0.8%    24  40%
"   Stroop and AX-CPT showed high retention and reliability.
"   Sternberg had high subject loss due to low trial counts in critical conditions.
?? Correlational Analyses
"   Explored within-task (e.g., Stroop baseline vs. proactive) and between-task (e.g., AX-CPT vs. Sternberg) correlations.
"   Used Mahalanobis distance to detect bivariate outliers (cutoff = 10.828, ? = .001).
?? Implications for Psychometric Design
"   Low between-subject variance and high within-subject variance make these tasks robust for experimental replication but challenging for individual difference measurement.
"   HBM offers advantages over traditional methods by modeling latent distributions and accounting for intra-individual variability.
"   Improving reliability is essential to uncover true correlations between cognitive control constructs.
?? Application to Your Framework
This study aligns with your goals in several ways:
"   Experimental Student Record: Supports the use of reaction time-based simulations and panel evaluations for trade test calibration.
"   Psychometric Evaluation: Reinforces the need for multi-method reliability (e.g., ICC, HBM) in assessing cognitive control and readiness.
"   Portfolio Value: Suggests integrating lognormal RT modeling and error rate thresholds into your VBA modules for psychometric scoring.
"   Career Readiness Index: Could incorporate HBM-derived parameters (e.g., ?, ?) as part of cognitive benchmarks.
Would you like me to help you design a VBA module that integrates DMCC-style psychometric scoring (e.g., ICC, RT variance, error thresholds) into your career readiness dashboard?

?? Key Reliability Metrics Explained
Metric Description
Split-half  Internal consistency across trials within a session (corrected via permutation)
ICC(2,1)    Test-retest reliability: absolute agreement between sessions
ICC(3,1)    Test-retest reliability: consistency across sessions
M (Mean)    Average reaction time or error rate
Range   Spread of RT or error rate across subjects
?? Reaction Time Reliability Summary
Task    Session Split-half  ICC(2,1)    ICC(3,1)    Mean RT (ms)    Range (ms)
Stroop Effect   Baseline    .82 .27 .29 137 267-385
BX Interference Proactive   .77 .50 .49 51  91-493
TRCE    Reactive    .59 .40 .40 94  642-967
Recency Effect  Baseline    .08 .26 .27 117 201-480
?? Insight: Aggregate RT measures (e.g., congruent/incongruent RTs) show higher reliability (up to r = 1.00), while derived effects (e.g., Stroop effect) are weaker (r ? .82). Recency effects consistently show low reliability.
?? Error Rate Reliability Summary
Task    Session Split-half  ICC(2,1)    ICC(3,1)    Mean Error (%)  Range (%)
Stroop Effect   Reactive    .88 .79 .79 2.3 28-21
BX Interference Baseline    .62 .27 .33 1.08    -.52 to 2.83
TRCE    Proactive   .74 .46 .46 10.7    14-56
Recency Effect  Baseline    -.21    .10 .11 13.8    12-60
?? Insight: Error rate reliability is generally lower than RT reliability. The Stroop effect in the reactive session stands out with high consistency (ICC ? .79), while Recency effects again show poor reliability.
?? Implications for Psychometric Evaluation
"   Stroop and BX tasks are reliable for both RT and error rate measures, especially in reactive and proactive sessions.
"   Recency effects may not be suitable for individual difference analysis due to low reliability.
"   TRCE shows moderate reliability and may benefit from enhanced task design or scoring models.
"   Split-half reliability is consistently higher than test-retest ICCs, suggesting stable internal consistency but variable cross-session performance.
?? Application to Career Readiness & Didactic Frameworks
These findings can be integrated into your VBA modules and career dashboards by:
"   Weighting task reliability in psychometric scoring algorithms.
"   Flagging low-reliability tasks (e.g., Recency) for exclusion or redesign.
"   Using ICC metrics to calibrate readiness thresholds for trade test certification.
"   Embedding split-half and ICC logic into your VBA logigram for dynamic scoring.
I can now help you design a VBA function that calculates ICC(2,1) and ICC(3,1) from RT or error data, or simulate reliability thresholds for trade test readiness. Let me know which task you'd like to model first.
?? Psychometric Grade Rank Calculation
Component Description
Inputs  Cognitive scores, personality traits, integrity metrics (e.g., 3SAQ or PVQ)
Normalization   Convert raw scores to percentile ranks or z-scores
Weighting   Apply weights per domain (e.g., 40% cognitive, 30% personality, 30% integrity)
Final Grade Rank    Aggregate weighted scores into a rank or readiness index
Example VBA logic:
vb
finalScore = (cognitive * 0.4 + personality * 0.3 + integrity * 0.3)
gradeRank = WorksheetFunction.Rank(finalScore, ScoreArray, 0)
?? Class Frequency & Distribution Analysis
Class/Entity    Frequency Metric    Period/Source
Microsoft, Schneider, Aton  Training cohorts per year   LMS or HR dashboards
SAPS, Metro Policing, IP    Recruitment cycles, psychometric pass rates Public service panels
City Power, Eskom   Trade test success, panel readiness DHET/TVET records
St Peace College, AIU, RNF  Didactic class frequency, battery memory modules    Institutional LMS logs
Asciebono, TNATED, NCV  Curriculum alignment, SAQA credits  DHET/SAQA qualification tables
Use Excel or VBA to calculate:
"   Mean: =AVERAGE(range)
"   Variance: =VAR.P(range)
"   Frequency: =COUNTIF(range, criteria)
"   Correlation: =CORREL(array1, array2)
?? Panel Instrument Control & Didactic Mapping
Metric Application
Panel Evaluation Score  Trade readiness, public service deployment
Instrument Control Marks    Technical proficiency in electrical/mechatronics modules
Didactic Class Frequency    Number of instructional sessions per module or term
Battery Memory Data LMS retention, simulation performance, cognitive load tracking
Example correlation logic:
vb
Correlation = WorksheetFunction.Correl(PanelScores, InstrumentMarks)
?? Integration with SAQA/DHET & Career Systems
"   SAQA ID 72052: Electrical Engineering FET Certificate
"  SAQA ID 90674: National N-Diploma in Electrical Engineering
"  DHET Curriculum Tables: Define credit periods, class frequency, and qualification mapping
These frameworks support credential-linked progression, trade test validation, and public service alignment.
Would you like me to generate a VBA module that calculates psychometric rank, class frequency, and correlation across these entities and periods? I can also scaffold it for bilingual export or ICASS/TVET compliance.

?? Phenomenological Engagement in Career Counselling Education
Phenomenology in career counselling reframes education as a relational, embodied, and experiential process, countering consumerist and instrumentalist mindsets. Key pedagogical strategies include:
"   Embodied Knowing: Teaching career psychology as lived experience, not abstract theory.
"   Mirrored Theories: Integrating frameworks like:
o   Systems Theory Framework (STF): Emphasizes group membership and relational contexts.
o   Social Cognitive Career Theory (SCCT): Focuses on self-efficacy, exposure, and reinforcement.
o   Career Construction Theory (CCT): Explores identity, motivation, and life roles.
o   Narrative & Happenstance Learning: Encourages agency, chance events, and future-oriented storytelling.
These approaches foster phenomenological consciousness-the ability to engage with clients' lifeworld realities through reflective, dialogic, and context-sensitive methods
.
?? Assessment & Competency Modeling in Electrical Engineering Education
In contrast, engineering education leverages Item Response Theory (IRT) and Partial Credit Models (PCM) to quantify student competence across structured tasks:
"   Task Types: Circuit analysis, MOSFET modeling, Thévenin equivalents, superposition, and energy calculations.
"   IRT Parameters:
o   WMNSQ (Weighted Mean Square): Ideal range 0.5-1.5
o   T-value: Should be < |2|
o   EAP (Expected A Posteriori): > 0.7
o   Resolution Rate: Between 5% and 95%
Students are classified into four levels of competence (Level 1 to Level 4), anchored by solution rates and difficulty estimates. For example:
"   Level 1: No milestone achievement, <50% solution rate
"   Level 4: High competence, anchored items with >65% solution rate
This model supports criterion-referenced interpretation, adaptive testing, and curriculum refinement
.
?? Bridging the Two Domains
Both frameworks-phenomenological counselling and IRT-based engineering assessment-share a commitment to:
"   Contextualized learning: Whether through lifeworld narratives or circuit simulations.
"   Competency development: Psychological insight vs. technical mastery.
"   Reflective practice: Career identity formation vs. problem-solving calibration.
Together, they offer a dual lens for designing educational systems that are both human-centered and performance-driven.
I can help you design a VBA module that models career counselling readiness using SCCT and CCT dimensions, or simulate IRT-based scoring for electrical engineering tasks. Just say the word and I'll scaffold it for your credential-linked framework.

?? Categories of Student Conceptual Change (Questions 1 & 6)
1. Wrong Answer + Wrong Explanation ? Correct Answer + Correct Explanation
"   Initial misconception: Belief that bulb brightness depends on its position relative to resistors.
"   Post-test shift: Recognition that resistor order doesn't affect current; brightness depends on total resistance.
"   Example: "The bulb is brighter because it is before the resistors" ? "It does not matter which order they are in."
2. Correct Answer + Wrong Explanation ? Correct Answer + Correct Explanation
"   Initial reasoning flaw: Guessing or misattributing brightness to fewer resistors without linking to current flow.
"   Post-test improvement: Clear articulation of Ohm's Law and current-resistance relationship.
3. Correct Answer + No Explanation ? Correct Answer + Informed Explanation
"   Initial gap: Correct guesses without conceptual grounding.
"   Post-test gain: Use of terms like "flow of electrons," "resistance," and "brightness" in scientifically accurate ways.
4. Correct Answer + Correct Explanation ? Refined Explanation
"   Initial strength: Sound understanding using formal physics (e.g., V = IR).
"   Post-test evolution: Shift toward model-based language (e.g., "resistor controls the flow of current"), showing influence of software metaphors and analogies.
5. No Answer ? Correct Answer + Explanation
"   Initial disengagement or uncertainty.
"   Post-test engagement: Adoption of peer-like language and analogical reasoning (e.g., "resistors control the flow of current").
?? Pedagogical Implications
"   Software influence is evident not only in correcting misconceptions but also in reshaping the language students use to express understanding.
"   Even high-performing students adapted their explanations to reflect the models and analogies introduced by the software.
"   The shift from formulaic reasoning (e.g., V = IR) to conceptual metaphors (e.g., "resistors control flow") suggests deeper embodied understanding.
?? Suggested VBA Extension
Would you like a VBA module that:
"   Tracks student category transitions (e.g., from "no explanation" to "model-based explanation")?
"   Calculates a conceptual change score based on explanation quality and language shift?
"   Flags students for targeted feedback or remedial support?
I can scaffold that next to support your didactic panel or ICASS-aligned reporting system.

?? Strategic Framework for Logigram & Algorigram Integration
?? Core Components Identified
Type    Examples    Purpose
.cls Class Modules  Class1, Class2 career forms Define object-oriented structures for career pathways, credential mapping
.frm UserForms  UserForm190000002, UserForm7 tshingombe, UserFormtrade certificate sttemnt  Interface for user input, registration, CPD tracking, trade theory
.bas Modules    Module992, Module6 autodidactic, NewMacros 991, assessment.bas  Contain procedural logic for automation, assessment, instrumentation
?? Logigram & Algorigram Automation Strategy
1. Logigram Logic (Process Flow)
Use .bas modules to define:
"   Credential progression (e.g., from trade theory to CPD to certification)
"   Event-driven triggers (e.g., when a UserForm is submitted, update audit sheet)
"   Conditional routing (e.g., if module complete ? unlock next form)
Example snippet:
vb
If UserForm7.cboTrade.Value = "Electrical" Then
    Call LoadElectricalModule
ElseIf UserForm7.cboTrade.Value = "Mechanical" Then
    Call LoadMechanicalModule
End If
2. Algorigram Logic (Decision Trees)
Use .cls and .bas to encode:
"   Assessment scoring algorithms
"   Instrument selection logic
"   Career path branching based on user input
Example:
vb

    If total >= 80 Then
        EvaluateScore = "Distinction"
    ElseIf total >= 60 Then
        EvaluateScore = "Merit"
    Else
        EvaluateScore = "Pass"
    Else
        EvaluateScore = "Fail"
    End If
End Function

This project was part of an an employment application to Uturn Data Solutions to test infrastructure skills. They provided a pre-coded AWS DynamoDB and Python based API application that was to be pulled and stood up to run on cloud infrastructure. I utilized AWS, OpenTofu (a fork of Terraform), and GitLab CI. There are two web servers behind a load balancer for redundancy.

?? Visual Basic Integration Idea
You can build a GitHub Project Navigator in VBA that lets you:
"   Select a category (e.g., "Engineering", "Blockchain", "Education")
"   View a list of related repositories
"   Open the GitHub page directly
"   Log access for audit or credential tracking
Sample VBA Snippet

    Dim Category As String
    Category = InputBox("Enter category (e.g., Engineering, Blockchain, Education):")

    Select Case LCase(Category)
        Case "engineering"
            Call OpenURL("https://github.com/Kananga5/engineering-workbaseexperimental-tshingombe-magazine-triggered")

        Case "blockchain"
            Call OpenURL("https://github.com/Kananga5/bitcoin")

        Case "education"
            Call OpenURL("https://github.com/Kananga5/education-technologe-saqa-result")

        Case Else
            MsgBox "Category not recognized. Try Engineering, Blockchain, or Education.", vbExclamation
    End Select
End Sub


    ThisWorkbook.FollowHyperlink Address:=url, NewWindow:=True
End Sub
Would you like me to help you build a full VBA dashboard that links all your GitHub repositories to your credential-linked modules, audit logs, or didactic panel templates?

## GitLab CI

This project 's static Pages are built by [GitLab CI][ci], following the steps
defined in [`.gitlab-ci.yml`](.gitlab-ci.yml):

```
image: busybox

pages:
stage:   deploy
script:
  - echo 'Nothing to do...'
artifacts:
paths:
    - public
    expire_in: 1 day
rules:
    - if: $CI_COMMIT_REF_NAME == $CI_DEFAULT_BRANCH
```

The above example expects to put all your HTML files in the `public/` directory.

## GitLab User or Group Pages

To use this project as your user/group website, you will need one additional
step: just rename your project to `namespace.gitlab.io`, where `namespace` is
your `username` or `groupname`. This can be done by navigating to your
project 's **Settings**.

Read more about [user/group Pages][userpages] and [project Pages][projpages].

## Did you fork this project?

If you forked this project for your own use, please go to your project's
**Settings** and remove the forking relationship, which won't be necessary
unless you want to contribute back to the upstream project.

## Troubleshooting

1. CSS is missing! That means that you have wrongly set up the CSS URL in your
   HTML files. Have a look at the [index.html] for an example.

Abstract
?? Author: Tshingombe Tshitadi
Primary Title: Career Drawing Total Programming: Analysis, Design, Investigation
Secondary Title: Application Trade Discovery: Job Education Research Methodology, Operational Autodidactic Copilote Distance
?? Overview & Scope
This research explores the convergence of career programming, trade discovery, and autodidactic learning within a modular, signal-driven framework. It proposes a system where job education, research methodology, and copilote-assisted distance learning are integrated into a dynamic platform for vocational and academic advancement.
?? Key Description
"   Domains: Career architecture, curriculum design, signal control, PCB implementation, vocational diagnostics
"   Tools: Visual Basic logigrammes, microcontroller loops, PLC command circuits, ATM logic, curriculum dashboards
"   Frameworks: AIU career center, CPD Scotland, SAQA, NATED, RNF, SCIE, trade company integration
?? Data Analysis
"   Sources: CVs, thesis publications, experimental portfolios, discovery logs, inventory records
"   Signals: Career progression (junior/senior), award validation, curriculum mapping
"   Metrics: Energy output, signal classification (linear/non-linear), grid stability, skill level tracking
?? Methodology & Investigation
"   Approach: Operational autodidactic learning via copilote-assisted systems
"   Techniques: PCB design, microcontroller testing, breadboard diagnostics, signal modulation (Fourier, Laplace)
"   Process Flow:
"   Career Signal ? Curriculum ? Award Entry ? Outcome
"   Signal Register ? Load Type ? Control System
"   ATM Logic ? PLC Diagnostics ? Microcontroller Loop
"   Inventory Discovery ? Trade Application ? Publication Archive
"
Print Advantages

    Dim careerPath As String
    Dim assessmentScore As Integer
    Dim exportReady As Boolean

    ' Load career logic
    Set careerPath = LoadCareerPath("Class1_total_career_aiu_eato_scheinder_alison_saqa_rnf_total_programm_form_combie.cls")

    ' Run autodidactic assessment
    assessmentScore = RunAssessment("Module6_9009999_autodidactic_drawin_copilote_assess_assign_total_career.bas")

    ' Check if export conditions are met
    exportReady = CheckExportReadiness(assessmentScore)

    If exportReady Then
        Call GenerateAuditSheet("Module992.bas")
        MsgBox "Credential-linked audit sheet generated successfully."
    Else
        MsgBox "Assessment incomplete. Please review learning modules."
    End If
End Sub
?? Integration with Didactic Panels & Trade Theory
Your .docx and .pdf files (e.g., careeer_20_drawig_material_didactic_autopedagogie_panel_teach.docx) can be modularized into:
"   Panel-based learning outcomes
"   Trade theory validation
"   CPD and NATED framework alignment
"   Portfolio evidence for SAQA, AIU, Eaton, Schneider, Alison
?? Next Steps
I can help you:

8.  Based on Schneider Electric's product categories and industrial automation portfolio, here's a modular Visual Basic logigram/algorigram scaffold that you can use to build an interactive selector, dashboard, or credential-linked audit sheet:
9.  ?? Visual Basic Logigram/Algorigram Framework for Product Categorization
10. ?? Class Module: ProductCategory.cls

    If cboCategory.Value = "" Then
        MsgBox "Please select a product category."
    ElseIf lstSubCategory.ListCount = 0 Then
        MsgBox "No subcategories found. Please verify category selection."
    Else
        MsgBox "Selection complete. Proceeding to export."
        Call ExportSelection
    End If
End Sub
This scaffold can be extended to:
"   Link product selection to credential modules (e.g., trade theory, energy systems)
"   Integrate with Schneider's Product Selector Tool or training catalog
"   Export bilingual audit sheets for SAQA, AIU, or trade board compliance
I can help you scaffold this into a full UserForm or link it to your existing modules like FORM_TSHINGOMBE..TSHI_PLC.frm or frm13_metering.frm. Just say the word.
11. Great - let's build something in Visual Basic. Since you've shared a vast archive of forms and modules tied to credentialing, trade theory, and infrastructure systems, here's a foundational Visual Basic logigram/algorigram scaffold that you can adapt across your UserForms like FORM_TSHINGOMBE..TSHI_PLC.frm, frm13_metering.frm, and UserForm999_trade_practice.frm.

        Call RunCredentialFlow
    Else
        MsgBox "Please complete all required fields."

This modular logic can be extended to:
"   Integrate with LDAP or Active Directory for user validation
"   Link to EcoStruxure™ IT APIs for infrastructure monitoring
"   Export bilingual audit sheets for SAQA, AIU, or trade board compliance
Would you like me to scaffold this into a specific UserForm like FORM_TSHINGOMBE..TSHI_PLC.frm or link it to a metering or licensing module next?

    ' Load career logic
    Set careerPath = LoadCareerPath("Class1_total_career_aiu_eato_scheinder_alison_saqa_rnf_total_programm_form_combie.cls")

End Sub
?? Integration with Didactic Panels & Trade Theory
Your .docx and .pdf files (e.g., careeer_20_drawig_material_didactic_autopedagogie_panel_teach.docx) can be modularized into:
"   Panel-based learning outcomes
"   Trade theory validation
"   CPD and NATED framework alignment
"   Portfolio evidence for SAQA, AIU, Eaton, Schneider, Alison
?? Next Steps
I can help you:
"   Scaffold a bilingual export-ready dashboard using these modules
"   Automate milestone tracking and credential validation
"   Link UserForms to dynamic logigram/algorigram flows
"   Modularize legal compliance and trade test logic
Just let me know which module or UserForm you'd like to activate

This scaffold can be extended to:
"   Link product selection to credential modules (e.g., trade theory, energy systems)
"   Integrate with Schneider's Product Selector Tool or training catalog
"   Export bilingual audit sheets for SAQA, AIU, or trade board compliance
I can help you scaffold this into a full UserForm or link it to your existing modules like FORM_TSHINGOMBE..TSHI_PLC.frm or frm13_metering.frm. Just say the word.
11. Great - let's build something in Visual Basic. Since you've shared a vast archive of forms and modules tied to credentialing, trade theory, and infrastructure systems, here's a foundational Visual Basic logigram/algorigram scaffold that you can adapt across your UserForms like FORM_TSHINGOMBE..TSHI_PLC.frm, frm13_metering.frm, and UserForm999_trade_practice.frm.

This modular logic can be extended to:
"   Integrate with LDAP or Active Directory for user validation
"   Link to EcoStruxure™ IT APIs for infrastructure monitoring
