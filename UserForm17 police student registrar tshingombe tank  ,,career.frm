Web-Based Crime Management System for Samara City Main Police Station

Demelash Lemmi Ettisa1, Minota Milkias2
Abstract

Crime is a human experience, and it must be controlled. The Samara town police station plays a significant role in controlling crime. However, the management of crime activities is done manually, which is due to the lack of an automated system that supports the station workers in communicating with citizens to share information and store, retrieve, and manage crime activities. To control crime efficiently, we need to develop online crime management systems.

This project, entitled "Web-Based Crime Management System," is designed to develop an online application in which any citizen can report crimes; if anybody wants to file a complaint against crimes, they must enjoy online communication with the police. This project provides records of crimes that have led to disciplinary cases in addition to being used to simply retrieve information from the database. The system implemented is a typical web-based crime record management system based on client-server architecture, allowing data storage and crime record interchange with police stations.

A criminal is a popular term used for a person who has committed a crime or has been legally convicted of a crime. "Criminal" also means being connected with a crime. When certain acts or people are involved in or related to a crime, they are termed as criminal (Wex, 2023).

Samara City 's main police station is located in Samara City, within the Afar Regional State. It was established in 1984 E.C. with the purpose of protecting local communities from criminal activities. The Samara City police station is situated near the diesel suppliers in Samara City. In the first phase, there was a small number of police members, including commanders, inspectors, and constables. But recently, more than 170 police members have been employed. It is a well-organized police station that serves in crime prevention; the detection and conviction of criminals depend on a highly responsive manner. The effectiveness of this station is based on how efficient, reliable, and fast it is. As a consequence, the station maintains a large volume of information. To manage their information requirements, the station is currently using an information system. This system is manual and paper-based, where information is passed hand-to-hand, and information is kept in hard-copy paper files stored ordinarily in fili
