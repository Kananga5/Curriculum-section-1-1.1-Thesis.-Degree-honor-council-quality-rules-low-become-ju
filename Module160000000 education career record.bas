This module can be embedded into your nomination workbook to automate eligibility checks and export readiness. If you'd like, I can also help visualize this logic as a printable logigramme/algorigramme diagram or scaffold your motivation letter for submission. Let's make your nomination modular, traceable, and audit-ready.
Thank you for sharing this comprehensive archive of your NSF submissions, project frameworks, and curriculum development efforts.

Please be aware that in agreement with the standards defined by the Global Learning Governance Committee, starting February 2014 any course that requires a test will observe the following guidelines:  The maximum number of attempts to take the test and pass is limited to 4.  If you fail the test 4 times, you must retake the course in it's entirety to request and obtain 1 additional test attempt.  Once the test starts it will run continuously. You can not set bookmarks and / or re-enter. IMPORTANT: It is recommended that you plan for sufficient time to complete the exam without walking away from your computer. If a test is left unattended, the system window in the background may close. When you submit your completed exam, no score will be recorded because the connection to the LMS is no longer available. This failed submission counts as a test attempt. (Course Code: BLDSALE1234034) Training Purpose: Due

?? Actionable Next Steps
"   ? Civil Cases: Prioritize completing incomplete cases and uploading missing documents for pending reviews.
"   ??? Protection Order: Follow up on screening status and ensure supporting documents are submitted.
"   ?? Clearance: Finalize NRSO application and confirm identity verification.
"   ?? Deceased Estate: Monitor DHA verification and prepare supporting transcripts for CCMA and SAQA/DHET-related disputes.
"   ?? Legal Strategy: Consider consolidating civil and labour-related matters under a single legal advisor or case manager.
