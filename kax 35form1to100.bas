?? Integration Ideas
You can expand this code to:
"   Log status in a worksheet or database
"   Trigger alerts for failed imports
"   Link to credential mapping or curriculum modules
"   Route to GitHub pages using FollowHyperlink
Would you like help building a full dashboard that links these repositories to your Visual Basic forms, Eaton documentation, or institutional workflows? I can also help you automate retry logic for failed imports.

This project was part of an an employment application to Uturn Data Solutions to test infrastructure skills. They provided a pre-coded AWS DynamoDB and Python based API application that was to be pulled and stood up to run on cloud infrastructure. I utilized AWS, OpenTofu (a fork of Terraform), and GitLab CI. There are two web servers behind a load balancer for redundancy.

?? Visual Basic Integration Idea
You can build a GitHub Project Navigator in VBA that lets you:
"   Select a category (e.g., "Engineering", "Blockchain", "Education")
"   View a list of related repositories
"   Open the GitHub page directly
"   Log access for audit or credential tracking
Sample VBA Snippet
Sub OpenGitHubProject()
    Dim Category As String
    Category = InputBox("Enter category (e.g., Engineering, Blockchain, Education):")

    Select Case LCase(Category)
        Case "engineering"
            Call OpenURL("https://github.com/Kananga5/engineering-workbaseexperimental-tshingombe-magazine-triggered")

        Case "blockchain"
            Call OpenURL("https://github.com/Kananga5/bitcoin")

        Case "education"
            Call OpenURL("https://github.com/Kananga5/education-technologe-saqa-result")

        Case Else
            MsgBox "Category not recognized. Try Engineering, Blockchain, or Education.", vbExclamation
    End Select
End Sub

Sub OpenURL(url As String)
    ThisWorkbook.FollowHyperlink Address:=url, NewWindow:=True
End Sub
Would you like me to help you build a full VBA dashboard that links all your GitHub repositories to your credential-linked modules, audit logs, or didactic panel templates?

?? Integration Ideas
You can extend this code to:
"   Link to credential mapping modules (e.g., Call MapCredential("Cybersecurity"))
"   Trigger bilingual export logic (e.g., Call ExportToFrench("Installation"))
"   Log audit traceability (e.g., Call LogAccess("Manual"))
"   Embed into a dashboard for modular document access
I can help you build a full VBA interface or export matrix that links this logic to your Eaton, Schneider, and ASCO documentation. Just let me know which category or module you'd like to automate next.

?? How You Can Use This
"   Embed this into a macro-enabled Excel workbook or Access form
"   Expand the Select Case block with more documents from your list
"   Link this logic to credential mapping, audit traceability, or bilingual export workflows
I can help you build a full VBA dashboard that routes to certification documents, technical manuals, and product guides across Eaton, Schneider, and ASCO systems. Just let me know which category you'd like to automate next.

## GitLab CI

This Project 's static Pages are built by [GitLab CI][ci], following the steps
defined in [`.gitlab-ci.yml`](.gitlab-ci.yml):

```
image: busybox

pages:
stage:   deploy
script:
  - echo 'Nothing to do...'
artifacts:
paths:
    - public
    expire_in: 1 day
rules:
    - if: $CI_COMMIT_REF_NAME == $CI_DEFAULT_BRANCH
```

The above example expects to put all your HTML files in the `public/` directory.

## GitLab User or Group Pages

To use this project as your user/group website, you will need one additional
step: just rename your project to `namespace.gitlab.io`, where `namespace` is
your `username` or `groupname`. This can be done by navigating to your
Project 's **Settings**.

Read more about [user/group Pages][userpages] and [project Pages][projpages].

## Did you fork this project?

If you forked this project for your own use, please go to your project's
**Settings** and remove the forking relationship, which won't be necessary
unless you want to contribute back to the upstream project.

## Troubleshooting

1. CSS is missing! That means that you have wrongly set up the CSS URL in your
   HTML files. Have a look at the [index.html] for an example.

Thanks for sharing this rich extract from SAQA's Annual Report 2024/25. Here's a structured synthesis tailored to your credential-linked, modular framework development goals:
?? Strategic Themes from SAQA's 2024/25 Annual Report
1. ?? Policy Review and Implementation
SAQA reviewed and amended five core NQF policies:
"   Foreign Qualification Evaluation
"   Registration of Qualifications and Part-Qualifications
"   Recognition of Professional Bodies and Designations
"   Credit Accumulation and Transfer (CAT)
"   Level Descriptors for the NQF
?? Implementation was tracked through SAQA-QC engagements and a formal implementation report.
2. ?? Continental Alignment and Mobility
"   ACQF Referencing: SAQA led South Africa's referencing of the NQF to the African Continental Qualifications Framework (ACQF), forming a national reference team and producing a report due in 2025.
"   Addis Convention: SAQA advanced implementation through foreign qualification evaluations and policy development on partial studies and microcredentials.
3. ?? NLRD Expansion and Data Integrity
"   24.5 million learner achievements are now reflected on the NLRD.
"   SAQA is digitising legacy datasets and filling gaps via direct institutional engagement.
"   As of Feb 2025, 68% of verification requests were fulfilled, with a project plan underway to improve this.
4. ?? Articulation and Professional Designation Trust
"   All post-2014 qualifications on the NQF must have at least one articulation pathway.
"   SAQA identified gaps and requested updates from QCs.
"   A new SAQA Professional Body Model was approved to clarify roles and support designation registration.
5. ?? Organisational Development and Staff Learning
"   SAQA redesigned its structure with external evaluation support.
"   Every staff member completed at least two learning interventions per year, meeting the 5-year target.
6. ?? System Efficiency and Stakeholder Alignment
"   Landing pages were created for QCTO and Umalusi to submit qualifications.
"   CHE is developing a system to integrate with SAQA's services.
"   SAQA supports professional bodies in uploading designation data to the NLRD, with training and de-registration measures where needed.
?? Application to Your Modular Frameworks
This report offers a blueprint for:
"   Mapping policy revisions into credential-linked logigrams and export tables.
"   Tracking articulation pathways and professional body roles for didactic panel integration.
"   Embedding NLRD verification logic into your Visual Basic modules and dashboard systems.
"   Aligning with ACQF and Addis Convention for cross-border recognition and microcredential scaffolding.
Would you like me to help scaffold a bilingual dashboard or logigram that reflects these policy updates and performance targets?
Print Key; Compliance And Assurance; Highlights
"   The report is declared complete and accurate.
"   Financial statements are prepared per prescribed standards.
"   External auditors provided an independent opinion.
"   Reasonable assurance is given on the integrity of performance and HR information.
?? Relevance to Your Work
Given your role in curriculum architecture and credential-linked frameworks, this report is a valuable reference for:
"   Audit-aligned reporting structures for modular frameworks.
"   Governance and compliance templates that can be adapted for institutional dashboards.
"   Performance tracking aligned with NQF outcomes and 5-year targets.
"   Credential-linked HR and programme performance indicators for didactic panel integration.
Would you like me to help you extract or reformat specific sections-like the Strategic Overview, Programme Performance, or PFMA Compliance-for integration into your modular dashboards or credential-linked templates?

?? Supplier Registration Summary - Department of Higher Education and Training (DHET)
?? Purpose
To register suppliers on DHET's approved database in compliance with the Public Finance Management Act (PFMA) and Accounting Officers Procurement Procedures (AOPP), ensuring equal opportunity and efficient procurement.
?? Key Registration Requirements
"   Mandatory Documents:
o   Company registration certificate
o   Tax clearance certificate
o   VAT certificate (if applicable)
o   ID copies of directors
o   Accreditation certificates
o   Cancelled cheque or bank verification letter
o   Company profile (max 2 pages)
"   Form Completion Rules:
o   All fields must be completed in black ink
o   No faxed or unsigned forms accepted
o   Changes must be reported within 14 days
o   False information or fronting leads to blacklisting
?? Supplier Classification
"   Business Type: Sole Proprietor, Partnership, CC, Pty Ltd, Trust, Section 21, Consortium, Joint Venture
"   SMME Status: Micro, Very Small, Small, Medium, Large
"   Sector: Engineering, Education, Construction, ICT, Professional Services, etc.
"   Ownership: HDI, Women Equity, Disability status declared
?? Management System Information
"   Database Updates: Quarterly, with summary verification
"   Conflict of Interest Declaration: Required for all owners/directors
"   Verification: DHET reserves the right to inspect premises
"   Communication: Must include operating fax number for updates
?? Core Business and Commodity Registration
"   Suppliers must define:
o   Core Business (e.g., engineering education, technical documentation, mentoring)
o   Trade Names (if sole distributor)
o   Commodities (from construction, services, professional, or wholesale categories)
?? Legal and Compliance Notes
"   Insolvent applicants must provide rehabilitation proof
"   Blacklisted entities must be cleared before registration
"   Registration does not guarantee contract award
"   Misrepresentation may lead to deregistration and legal action
?? Integration Potential for Your Framework
This registration logic can be modularized into:
"   Visual Basic logigram: mapping supplier compliance steps to PFMA audit sheets
"   Algorigram: tracking document submission, verification, and approval flow
"   Credential-linked export tables: for supplier classification, SMME status, and commodity mapping
"   Bilingual dashboards: for public service readiness and institutional traceability
"   Absolutely, Tshingombe. Here's a tailored Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) module that scaffolds a logigram-style dashboard for tracking supplier registration and compliance verification aligned with PFMA and DHET protocols.

you 've compiled an impressive and extensive library of Visual Basic modules, UserForms, class files, and didactic documentation-clearly reflecting your commitment to modular credential-linked systems, autopedagogie, and trade education integration. Here's how we can scaffold and synthesize this into a structured logigram/algorigram framework for automation, credential export, and audit traceability:
?? Logigram & Algorigram Automation Framework (Visual Basic)
?? Core Modules & Classes
These form the backbone of your credential-linked logic:
Component Purpose
Class1_total_career_aiu_eato_scheinder_alison_saqa_rnf_total_programm_form_combie.cls   Central career logic class for credential mapping
Module_total_kfrm1t0_kfrm40_k1_to_total_subject_learning.bas    Subject learning flow and milestone tracking
Module6_9009999_autodidactic_drawin_copilote_assess_assign_total_career.bas Autodidactic drawing and assessment logic
Module992.bas, Module991.bas    Credential export and audit sheet generation
Module5_900000_assessment.bas   Trade and education assessment logic
Module_k1.bas to Module_k6.cls  Sequential algorigram logic for modular flow
?? UserForms for Credential-Linked Interaction
These support user input, registration, and career mapping:

?? UserForms for Credential-Linked Interaction
These support user input, registration, and career mapping:
UserForm    Function
UserForm_190000002_integrator_artificial_module_career_and_training.frm AI-integrated career and training module
UserForm7_tshingombe.frm    Personalized registration and didactic panel
UserForm90000_inventory.frm Inventory and panel traceability

UserForm_trade_certificate_sttemnt.frm  Trade certificate and statement logic
UserForm_license_algorith_protect.frm   Licensing and algorithm protection
?? Logigram/Algorigram Logic Flow
You can structure your automation like this:

    Dim careerPath As String
    Dim assessmentScore As Integer
    Dim exportReady As Boolean

    ' Load career logic
    Set careerPath = LoadCareerPath("Class1_total_career_aiu_eato_scheinder_alison_saqa_rnf_total_programm_form_combie.cls")

    ' Run autodidactic assessment
    assessmentScore = RunAssessment("Module6_9009999_autodidactic_drawin_copilote_assess_assign_total_career.bas")

    ' Check if export conditions are met
    exportReady = CheckExportReadiness(assessmentScore)

    If exportReady Then
        Call GenerateAuditSheet("Module992.bas")
        MsgBox "Credential-linked audit sheet generated successfully."
    Else
        MsgBox "Assessment incomplete. Please review learning modules."
    End If
End Sub
?? Integration with Didactic Panels & Trade Theory
Your .docx and .pdf files (e.g., careeer_20_drawig_material_didactic_autopedagogie_panel_teach.docx) can be modularized into:
"   Panel-based learning outcomes
"   Trade theory validation
"   CPD and NATED framework alignment
"   Portfolio evidence for SAQA, AIU, Eaton, Schneider, Alison
?? Next Steps
I can help you:
"   Scaffold a bilingual export-ready dashboard using these modules
"   Automate milestone tracking and credential validation
"   Link UserForms to dynamic logigram/algorigram flows
"   Modularize legal compliance and trade test logic
Just let me know which module or UserForm you'd like to activate

?? Career Scope & Job Roles
"   Career scope defines the range of opportunities available within a field, shaped by qualifications, experience, and evolving industry needs.
"   Job roles are specific positions with defined duties, often aligned to institutional frameworks like those at DUT, where roles span academic, administrative, technical, and research domains.
?? Psychometric Evaluation
"   Purpose: Measures cognitive abilities, personality traits, values, and aptitudes to guide career decisions and recruitment.
"   Application:
o   Career guidance: Helps students choose subjects and career paths aligned with their strengths
"  .
"  Recruitment: Offers objective data to reduce bias and improve hiring decisions
"  .
"  Performance prediction: Assesses traits linked to workplace success, such as resilience, teamwork, and leadership
"
o   .
?? Career Performance & Recruitment
"   Performance tracking: Involves KPIs, feedback systems, and developmental reviews to monitor growth and readiness for promotion or reassignment.
"   Recruitment:
o   Uses psychometric tools to ensure fair, data-driven selection.
o   Aligns candidate traits with job requirements, especially in multidisciplinary environments like DUT
"
o   .
?? Experimental Student Record & Assessment
"   Experimental records: Capture non-traditional learning outcomes, such as project-based work, simulations, or panel evaluations.
"   Assessment types:
o   Formative: Ongoing feedback to guide learning.
o   Summative: Final evaluations for certification or progression.
o   Diagnostic: Identifies learning gaps or strengths.
"   Role in career development: Supports credential-linked progression and readiness for trade tests or public service deployment.
??? DUT Post Roles & Institutional Alignment
"   DUT roles may include:
o   Lecturer/Researcher: Focused on curriculum delivery and innovation.
o   Technician/Panel Facilitator: Supports practical training and assessment.
o   Administrator/Compliance Officer: Manages records, audits, and institutional reporting.
"   These roles often require modular documentation, panel-based evaluation, and alignment with SAQA/DHET standards, which you already specialize in.
Would you like me to map these components into a modular logigram or credential-linked framework for DUT or another institution?

Career psychometrics and job analytics combine statistical evaluation, recruitment metrics, and didactic portfolio tracking to optimize learning, placement, and labour reconciliation.
Here 's a structured breakdown of your multifaceted framework, integrating psychometric, statistical, and didactic dimensions:
?? Psychometric Calculation & Recruitment Goals
"   Psychometric tools assess cognitive ability, personality, abstract reasoning, and learning potential
"   .
"   Recruitment goals align psychometric profiles with job classes (junior, senior, cadet) to ensure role fit and career progression.
"   Job duty averages are derived from performance benchmarks and psychometric alignment.
?? Statistical Metrics for Career Analysis
"   Mean & variance: Used to calculate average performance, salary distribution, and recruitment success rates.
"   Job class frequency: Tracks how often roles are posted or filled, aiding workforce planning.
"   Loss accumulation: Measures salary gaps, missed opportunities, and benefit forfeiture due to non-placement or regret scenarios.
?? Portfolio Submission & Didactic Value
"   Career portfolios include:
o   Psychometric scores
o   Learning achievements (e.g., LMS completions)
o   Trade test results
o   Panel-based evaluations
"   Didactic value: Quantifies readiness for real job deployment, using modular frameworks and autopedagogie principles.
?? Job Simulation, Demo, and Real-World Testing
"   Demo jobs simulate tasks for training and psychometric calibration.
"   Real jobs validate learning outcomes through performance audits and trade test panels.
"   Trading function analysis: Applies statistical testing to job performance, especially in technical or economic roles.
?? Career Levels, Awards & Awareness
"   Junior/Senior/Cadet roles are mapped to psychometric thresholds and experiential milestones.
"   Awards recognize cognitive, theoretical, and practical excellence.
"   Awareness metrics track readiness, adaptability, and abstract reasoning.
?? Labour Conciliation & Ruling Integration
"   Labour rulings and conciliation outcomes are integrated into career analytics to:
o   Track dispute resolution
o   Align job duties with legal frameworks
o   Inform psychometric and performance recalibration
Would you like me to generate a logigram or VBA module that calculates job class frequency, psychometric variance, and portfolio value for trade test readiness?

?? Purpose of the Study
"   To assess individual differences in cognitive control using four classic tasks:
o Stroop
o AX - CPT
o   Task Switching
o Sternberg
"   To evaluate psychometric reliability (split-half and test-retest) across baseline, proactive, and reactive sessions.
?? Methodological Highlights
1. Data Cleaning & Trial Exclusion
"   Reaction times (RTs) >3 SDs above the mean were excluded.
"   Error rate cutoffs (e.g., 40%) were used to remove outliers.
"   Subjects with excessive trial loss were excluded from specific task analyses.
2. Reliability Estimation
"   Traditional methods:
o   Split-half reliability via 5000 permutations + Spearman-Brown correction.
o   Test-retest reliability using ICC(2,1) and ICC(3,1) (absolute agreement vs. consistency).
"   Hierarchical Bayesian Modeling (HBM):
o   Modeled RT distributions as lognormal, accounting for:
"   Subject-level variability
"   Trial-by-trial variance
"   Skewness in RT distributions
o   Provided generative estimates of test-retest reliability.
?? Key Findings
Task    RT Trials Removed   Subjects Removed    Error Rate Cutoff
Stroop  1.7%    1   40%
AX-CPT  2.9%    10  40%
Task Switching  1.5%    2   40%
Sternberg   0.8%    24  40%
"   Stroop and AX-CPT showed high retention and reliability.
"   Sternberg had high subject loss due to low trial counts in critical conditions.
?? Correlational Analyses
"   Explored within-task (e.g., Stroop baseline vs. proactive) and between-task (e.g., AX-CPT vs. Sternberg) correlations.
"   Used Mahalanobis distance to detect bivariate outliers (cutoff = 10.828, ? = .001).
?? Implications for Psychometric Design
"   Low between-subject variance and high within-subject variance make these tasks robust for experimental replication but challenging for individual difference measurement.
"   HBM offers advantages over traditional methods by modeling latent distributions and accounting for intra-individual variability.
"   Improving reliability is essential to uncover true correlations between cognitive control constructs.
?? Application to Your Framework
This study aligns with your goals in several ways:
"   Experimental Student Record: Supports the use of reaction time-based simulations and panel evaluations for trade test calibration.
"   Psychometric Evaluation: Reinforces the need for multi-method reliability (e.g., ICC, HBM) in assessing cognitive control and readiness.
"   Portfolio Value: Suggests integrating lognormal RT modeling and error rate thresholds into your VBA modules for psychometric scoring.
"   Career Readiness Index: Could incorporate HBM-derived parameters (e.g., ?, ?) as part of cognitive benchmarks.
Would you like me to help you design a VBA module that integrates DMCC-style psychometric scoring (e.g., ICC, RT variance, error thresholds) into your career readiness dashboard?

?? Key Reliability Metrics Explained
Metric Description
Split-half  Internal consistency across trials within a session (corrected via permutation)
ICC(2,1)    Test-retest reliability: absolute agreement between sessions
ICC(3,1)    Test-retest reliability: consistency across sessions
M (Mean)    Average reaction time or error rate
Range   Spread of RT or error rate across subjects
?? Reaction Time Reliability Summary
Task    Session Split-half  ICC(2,1)    ICC(3,1)    Mean RT (ms)    Range (ms)
Stroop Effect   Baseline    .82 .27 .29 137 267-385
BX Interference Proactive   .77 .50 .49 51  91-493
TRCE    Reactive    .59 .40 .40 94  642-967
Recency Effect  Baseline    .08 .26 .27 117 201-480
?? Insight: Aggregate RT measures (e.g., congruent/incongruent RTs) show higher reliability (up to r = 1.00), while derived effects (e.g., Stroop effect) are weaker (r ? .82). Recency effects consistently show low reliability.
?? Error Rate Reliability Summary
Task    Session Split-half  ICC(2,1)    ICC(3,1)    Mean Error (%)  Range (%)
Stroop Effect   Reactive    .88 .79 .79 2.3 28-21
BX Interference Baseline    .62 .27 .33 1.08    -.52 to 2.83
TRCE    Proactive   .74 .46 .46 10.7    14-56
Recency Effect  Baseline    -.21    .10 .11 13.8    12-60
?? Insight: Error rate reliability is generally lower than RT reliability. The Stroop effect in the reactive session stands out with high consistency (ICC ? .79), while Recency effects again show poor reliability.
?? Implications for Psychometric Evaluation
"   Stroop and BX tasks are reliable for both RT and error rate measures, especially in reactive and proactive sessions.
"   Recency effects may not be suitable for individual difference analysis due to low reliability.
"   TRCE shows moderate reliability and may benefit from enhanced task design or scoring models.
"   Split-half reliability is consistently higher than test-retest ICCs, suggesting stable internal consistency but variable cross-session performance.
?? Application to Career Readiness & Didactic Frameworks
These findings can be integrated into your VBA modules and career dashboards by:
"   Weighting task reliability in psychometric scoring algorithms.
"   Flagging low-reliability tasks (e.g., Recency) for exclusion or redesign.
"   Using ICC metrics to calibrate readiness thresholds for trade test certification.
"   Embedding split-half and ICC logic into your VBA logigram for dynamic scoring.
I can now help you design a VBA function that calculates ICC(2,1) and ICC(3,1) from RT or error data, or simulate reliability thresholds for trade test readiness. Let me know which task you'd like to model first.
?? Psychometric Grade Rank Calculation
Component Description
Inputs  Cognitive scores, personality traits, integrity metrics (e.g., 3SAQ or PVQ)
Normalization   Convert raw scores to percentile ranks or z-scores
Weighting   Apply weights per domain (e.g., 40% cognitive, 30% personality, 30% integrity)
Final Grade Rank    Aggregate weighted scores into a rank or readiness index
Example VBA logic:
vb
finalScore = (cognitive * 0.4 + personality * 0.3 + integrity * 0.3)
gradeRank = WorksheetFunction.Rank(finalScore, ScoreArray, 0)
?? Class Frequency & Distribution Analysis
Class/Entity    Frequency Metric    Period/Source
Microsoft, Schneider, Aton  Training cohorts per year   LMS or HR dashboards
SAPS, Metro Policing, IP    Recruitment cycles, psychometric pass rates Public service panels
City Power, Eskom   Trade test success, panel readiness DHET/TVET records
St Peace College, AIU, RNF  Didactic class frequency, battery memory modules    Institutional LMS logs
Asciebono, TNATED, NCV  Curriculum alignment, SAQA credits  DHET/SAQA qualification tables
Use Excel or VBA to calculate:
"   Mean: =AVERAGE(range)
"   Variance: =VAR.P(range)
"   Frequency: =COUNTIF(range, criteria)
"   Correlation: =CORREL(array1, array2)
?? Panel Instrument Control & Didactic Mapping
Metric Application
Panel Evaluation Score  Trade readiness, public service deployment
Instrument Control Marks    Technical proficiency in electrical/mechatronics modules
Didactic Class Frequency    Number of instructional sessions per module or term
Battery Memory Data LMS retention, simulation performance, cognitive load tracking
Example correlation logic:
vb
correlation = WorksheetFunction.Correl(PanelScores, InstrumentMarks)
?? Integration with SAQA/DHET & Career Systems
"   SAQA ID 72052: Electrical Engineering FET Certificate
"  SAQA ID 90674: National N-Diploma in Electrical Engineering
"  DHET Curriculum Tables: Define credit periods, class frequency, and qualification mapping
These frameworks support credential-linked progression, trade test validation, and public service alignment.
Would you like me to generate a VBA module that calculates psychometric rank, class frequency, and correlation across these entities and periods? I can also scaffold it for bilingual export or ICASS/TVET compliance.

?? Phenomenological Engagement in Career Counselling Education
Phenomenology in career counselling reframes education as a relational, embodied, and experiential process, countering consumerist and instrumentalist mindsets. Key pedagogical strategies include:
"   Embodied Knowing: Teaching career psychology as lived experience, not abstract theory.
"   Mirrored Theories: Integrating frameworks like:
o   Systems Theory Framework (STF): Emphasizes group membership and relational contexts.
o   Social Cognitive Career Theory (SCCT): Focuses on self-efficacy, exposure, and reinforcement.
o   Career Construction Theory (CCT): Explores identity, motivation, and life roles.
o   Narrative & Happenstance Learning: Encourages agency, chance events, and future-oriented storytelling.
These approaches foster phenomenological consciousness-the ability to engage with clients' lifeworld realities through reflective, dialogic, and context-sensitive methods
.
?? Assessment & Competency Modeling in Electrical Engineering Education
In contrast, engineering education leverages Item Response Theory (IRT) and Partial Credit Models (PCM) to quantify student competence across structured tasks:
"   Task Types: Circuit analysis, MOSFET modeling, Thévenin equivalents, superposition, and energy calculations.
"   IRT Parameters:
o   WMNSQ (Weighted Mean Square): Ideal range 0.5-1.5
o   T-value: Should be < |2|
o   EAP (Expected A Posteriori): > 0.7
o   Resolution Rate: Between 5% and 95%
Students are classified into four levels of competence (Level 1 to Level 4), anchored by solution rates and difficulty estimates. For example:
"   Level 1: No milestone achievement, <50% solution rate
"   Level 4: High competence, anchored items with >65% solution rate
This model supports criterion-referenced interpretation, adaptive testing, and curriculum refinement
.
?? Bridging the Two Domains
Both frameworks-phenomenological counselling and IRT-based engineering assessment-share a commitment to:
"   Contextualized learning: Whether through lifeworld narratives or circuit simulations.
"   Competency development: Psychological insight vs. technical mastery.
"   Reflective practice: Career identity formation vs. problem-solving calibration.
Together, they offer a dual lens for designing educational systems that are both human-centered and performance-driven.
I can help you design a VBA module that models career counselling readiness using SCCT and CCT dimensions, or simulate IRT-based scoring for electrical engineering tasks. Just say the word and I'll scaffold it for your credential-linked framework.

?? Categories of Student Conceptual Change (Questions 1 & 6)
1. Wrong Answer + Wrong Explanation ? Correct Answer + Correct Explanation
"   Initial misconception: Belief that bulb brightness depends on its position relative to resistors.
"   Post-test shift: Recognition that resistor order doesn't affect current; brightness depends on total resistance.
"   Example: "The bulb is brighter because it is before the resistors" ? "It does not matter which order they are in."
2. Correct Answer + Wrong Explanation ? Correct Answer + Correct Explanation
"   Initial reasoning flaw: Guessing or misattributing brightness to fewer resistors without linking to current flow.
"   Post-test improvement: Clear articulation of Ohm's Law and current-resistance relationship.
3. Correct Answer + No Explanation ? Correct Answer + Informed Explanation
"   Initial gap: Correct guesses without conceptual grounding.
"   Post-test gain: Use of terms like "flow of electrons," "resistance," and "brightness" in scientifically accurate ways.
4. Correct Answer + Correct Explanation ? Refined Explanation
"   Initial strength: Sound understanding using formal physics (e.g., V = IR).
"   Post-test evolution: Shift toward model-based language (e.g., "resistor controls the flow of current"), showing influence of software metaphors and analogies.
5. No Answer ? Correct Answer + Explanation
"   Initial disengagement or uncertainty.
"   Post-test engagement: Adoption of peer-like language and analogical reasoning (e.g., "resistors control the flow of current").
?? Pedagogical Implications
"   Software influence is evident not only in correcting misconceptions but also in reshaping the language students use to express understanding.
"   Even high-performing students adapted their explanations to reflect the models and analogies introduced by the software.
"   The shift from formulaic reasoning (e.g., V = IR) to conceptual metaphors (e.g., "resistors control flow") suggests deeper embodied understanding.
?? Suggested VBA Extension
Would you like a VBA module that:
"   Tracks student category transitions (e.g., from "no explanation" to "model-based explanation")?
"   Calculates a conceptual change score based on explanation quality and language shift?
"   Flags students for targeted feedback or remedial support?
I can scaffold that next to support your didactic panel or ICASS-aligned reporting system.

?? Strategic Framework for Logigram & Algorigram Integration
?? Core Components Identified
Type    Examples    Purpose
.cls Class Modules  Class1, Class2 career forms Define object-oriented structures for career pathways, credential mapping
.frm UserForms  UserForm190000002, UserForm7 tshingombe, UserFormtrade certificate sttemnt  Interface for user input, registration, CPD tracking, trade theory
.bas Modules    Module992, Module6 autodidactic, NewMacros 991, assessment.bas  Contain procedural logic for automation, assessment, instrumentation
?? Logigram & Algorigram Automation Strategy
1. Logigram Logic (Process Flow)
Use .bas modules to define:
"   Credential progression (e.g., from trade theory to CPD to certification)
"   Event-driven triggers (e.g., when a UserForm is submitted, update audit sheet)
"   Conditional routing (e.g., if module complete ? unlock next form)
Example Snippet:
vb
If UserForm7.cboTrade.Value = "Electrical" Then
    Call LoadElectricalModule
ElseIf UserForm7.cboTrade.Value = "Mechanical" Then
    Call LoadMechanicalModule
End If
2. Algorigram Logic (Decision Trees)
Use .cls and .bas to encode:
"   Assessment scoring algorithms
"   Instrument selection logic
"   Career path branching based on user input
Example:
vb

    If total >= 80 Then
        EvaluateScore = "Distinction"
    ElseIf total >= 60 Then
        EvaluateScore = "Merit"
    Else
        EvaluateScore = "Pass"
    Else
        EvaluateScore = "Fail"
    End If
End Function

This project was part of an an employment application to Uturn Data Solutions to test infrastructure skills. They provided a pre-coded AWS DynamoDB and Python based API application that was to be pulled and stood up to run on cloud infrastructure. I utilized AWS, OpenTofu (a fork of Terraform), and GitLab CI. There are two web servers behind a load balancer for redundancy.

?? Visual Basic Integration Idea
You can build a GitHub Project Navigator in VBA that lets you:
"   Select a category (e.g., "Engineering", "Blockchain", "Education")
"   View a list of related repositories
"   Open the GitHub page directly
"   Log access for audit or credential tracking
Sample VBA Snippet

    Dim Category As String
    Category = InputBox("Enter category (e.g., Engineering, Blockchain, Education):")

    Select Case LCase(Category)
        Case "engineering"
            Call OpenURL("https://github.com/Kananga5/engineering-workbaseexperimental-tshingombe-magazine-triggered")

        Case "blockchain"
            Call OpenURL("https://github.com/Kananga5/bitcoin")

        Case "education"
            Call OpenURL("https://github.com/Kananga5/education-technologe-saqa-result")

        Case Else
            MsgBox "Category not recognized. Try Engineering, Blockchain, or Education.", vbExclamation
    End Select
End Sub


    ThisWorkbook.FollowHyperlink Address:=url, NewWindow:=True
End Sub
Would you like me to help you build a full VBA dashboard that links all your GitHub repositories to your credential-linked modules, audit logs, or didactic panel templates?

## GitLab CI

This Project 's static Pages are built by [GitLab CI][ci], following the steps
defined in [`.gitlab-ci.yml`](.gitlab-ci.yml):

```
image: busybox

pages:
stage:   deploy
script:
  - echo 'Nothing to do...'
artifacts:
paths:
    - public
    expire_in: 1 day
rules:
    - if: $CI_COMMIT_REF_NAME == $CI_DEFAULT_BRANCH
```

The above example expects to put all your HTML files in the `public/` directory.

## GitLab User or Group Pages

To use this project as your user/group website, you will need one additional
step: just rename your project to `namespace.gitlab.io`, where `namespace` is
your `username` or `groupname`. This can be done by navigating to your
Project 's **Settings**.

Read more about [user/group Pages][userpages] and [project Pages][projpages].

## Did you fork this project?

If you forked this project for your own use, please go to your project's
**Settings** and remove the forking relationship, which won't be necessary
unless you want to contribute back to the upstream project.

## Troubleshooting

1. CSS is missing! That means that you have wrongly set up the CSS URL in your
   HTML files. Have a look at the [index.html] for an example.

Abstract
?? Author: Tshingombe Tshitadi
Primary Title: Career Drawing Total Programming: Analysis, Design, Investigation
Secondary Title: Application Trade Discovery: Job Education Research Methodology, Operational Autodidactic Copilote Distance
?? Overview & Scope
This research explores the convergence of career programming, trade discovery, and autodidactic learning within a modular, signal-driven framework. It proposes a system where job education, research methodology, and copilote-assisted distance learning are integrated into a dynamic platform for vocational and academic advancement.
?? Key Description
"   Domains: Career architecture, curriculum design, signal control, PCB implementation, vocational diagnostics
"   Tools: Visual Basic logigrammes, microcontroller loops, PLC command circuits, ATM logic, curriculum dashboards
"   Frameworks: AIU career center, CPD Scotland, SAQA, NATED, RNF, SCIE, trade company integration
?? Data Analysis
"   Sources: CVs, thesis publications, experimental portfolios, discovery logs, inventory records
"   Signals: Career progression (junior/senior), award validation, curriculum mapping
"   Metrics: Energy output, signal classification (linear/non-linear), grid stability, skill level tracking
?? Methodology & Investigation
"   Approach: Operational autodidactic learning via copilote-assisted systems
"   Techniques: PCB design, microcontroller testing, breadboard diagnostics, signal modulation (Fourier, Laplace)
"   Process Flow:
"   Career Signal ? Curriculum ? Award Entry ? Outcome
"   Signal Register ? Load Type ? Control System
"   ATM Logic ? PLC Diagnostics ? Microcontroller Loop
"   Inventory Discovery ? Trade Application ? Publication Archive
"
Print Advantages

?? Logigram/Algorigram Logic Flow
You can structure your automation like this:

    Dim careerPath As String
    Dim assessmentScore As Integer
    Dim exportReady As Boolean

    ' Load career logic
    Set careerPath = LoadCareerPath("Class1_total_career_aiu_eato_scheinder_alison_saqa_rnf_total_programm_form_combie.cls")

    ' Run autodidactic assessment
    assessmentScore = RunAssessment("Module6_9009999_autodidactic_drawin_copilote_assess_assign_total_career.bas")

    ' Check if export conditions are met
    exportReady = CheckExportReadiness(assessmentScore)

    If exportReady Then
        Call GenerateAuditSheet("Module992.bas")
        MsgBox "Credential-linked audit sheet generated successfully."
    Else
        MsgBox "Assessment incomplete. Please review learning modules."
    End If
End Sub
?? Integration with Didactic Panels & Trade Theory
Your .docx and .pdf files (e.g., careeer_20_drawig_material_didactic_autopedagogie_panel_teach.docx) can be modularized into:
"   Panel-based learning outcomes
"   Trade theory validation
"   CPD and NATED framework alignment
"   Portfolio evidence for SAQA, AIU, Eaton, Schneider, Alison
?? Next Steps
I can help you:

8.  Based on Schneider Electric's product categories and industrial automation portfolio, here's a modular Visual Basic logigram/algorigram scaffold that you can use to build an interactive selector, dashboard, or credential-linked audit sheet:
9.  ?? Visual Basic Logigram/Algorigram Framework for Product Categorization
10. ?? Class Module: ProductCategory.cls

    If cboCategory.Value = "" Then
        MsgBox "Please select a product category."
    ElseIf lstSubCategory.ListCount = 0 Then
        MsgBox "No subcategories found. Please verify category selection."
    Else
        MsgBox "Selection complete. Proceeding to export."
        Call ExportSelection
    End If
End Sub
This scaffold can be extended to:
"   Link product selection to credential modules (e.g., trade theory, energy systems)
"   Integrate with Schneider's Product Selector Tool or training catalog
"   Export bilingual audit sheets for SAQA, AIU, or trade board compliance
I can help you scaffold this into a full UserForm or link it to your existing modules like FORM_TSHINGOMBE..TSHI_PLC.frm or frm13_metering.frm. Just say the word.
11. Great - let's build something in Visual Basic. Since you've shared a vast archive of forms and modules tied to credentialing, trade theory, and infrastructure systems, here's a foundational Visual Basic logigram/algorigram scaffold that you can adapt across your UserForms like FORM_TSHINGOMBE..TSHI_PLC.frm, frm13_metering.frm, and UserForm999_trade_practice.frm.

        Call RunCredentialFlow
    Else
        MsgBox "Please complete all required fields."

This modular logic can be extended to:
"   Integrate with LDAP or Active Directory for user validation
"   Link to EcoStruxure™ IT APIs for infrastructure monitoring
"   Export bilingual audit sheets for SAQA, AIU, or trade board compliance
Would you like me to scaffold this into a specific UserForm like FORM_TSHINGOMBE..TSHI_PLC.frm or link it to a metering or licensing module next?

    ' Load career logic
    Set careerPath = LoadCareerPath("Class1_total_career_aiu_eato_scheinder_alison_saqa_rnf_total_programm_form_combie.cls")

End Sub
?? Integration with Didactic Panels & Trade Theory
Your .docx and .pdf files (e.g., careeer_20_drawig_material_didactic_autopedagogie_panel_teach.docx) can be modularized into:
"   Panel-based learning outcomes
"   Trade theory validation
"   CPD and NATED framework alignment
"   Portfolio evidence for SAQA, AIU, Eaton, Schneider, Alison
?? Next Steps
I can help you:
"   Scaffold a bilingual export-ready dashboard using these modules
"   Automate milestone tracking and credential validation
"   Link UserForms to dynamic logigram/algorigram flows
"   Modularize legal compliance and trade test logic
Just let me know which module or UserForm you'd like to activate

This scaffold can be extended to:
"   Link product selection to credential modules (e.g., trade theory, energy systems)
"   Integrate with Schneider's Product Selector Tool or training catalog
"   Export bilingual audit sheets for SAQA, AIU, or trade board compliance
I can help you scaffold this into a full UserForm or link it to your existing modules like FORM_TSHINGOMBE..TSHI_PLC.frm or frm13_metering.frm. Just say the word.
11. Great - let's build something in Visual Basic. Since you've shared a vast archive of forms and modules tied to credentialing, trade theory, and infrastructure systems, here's a foundational Visual Basic logigram/algorigram scaffold that you can adapt across your UserForms like FORM_TSHINGOMBE..TSHI_PLC.frm, frm13_metering.frm, and UserForm999_trade_practice.frm.

This modular logic can be extended to:
"   Integrate with LDAP or Active Directory for user validation
"   Link to EcoStruxure™ IT APIs for infrastructure monitoring

Thank you for sharing this rich and intricate framework, Tshingombe. Based on your modular VB-based form architecture and the layered data structure you've outlined, here's a structured academic-style synthesis that aligns with your request for an overview, description, scope, background, problem statement, data analysis, methodology, and conclusion-centered around your Information Management System (IMS) prototype.
?? Information Management System: Modular Framework Overview
Inventor: Tshingombe Tshitadi Fiston Email: tshingombefiston@gmail.com
1. ?? Topic
Design and implementation of a modular, form-driven Information Management System (IMS) for secure registration, biometric validation, and user credential handling across educational or administrative platforms.
2. ?? Overview
This system is a multi-form, event-driven application built using Visual Basic (VB) architecture. It facilitates user registration, credential management, biometric scanning, and secure communication. The design emphasizes modularity, traceability, and audit-readiness, aligning with national curriculum and compliance standards.
3. ?? Description
The IMS comprises six core forms (Kfrm1-Kfrm6), each handling a distinct phase of user interaction:
"
Kfrm1: Initial Registration(Name, Surname, id, cellphone)
"
"
Kfrm2: Address and birthday capture
"
"
Kfrm3: Registration Confirmation
"
"
Kfrm4: Account login and password recovery
"
"
Kfrm5: Password resend and record saving
"
"
Kfrm6: Security scanner and biometric validation
"
Each form is populated with labels, combo boxes, command buttons, and event-driven subroutines. The system integrates email recall, signature management, and out-of-office automation.
4. ?? Scope
"
Included: User registration, biometric scanning, credential management, email automation, database interaction, and modular form navigation.
"
"
Excluded: External API integration, mobile app deployment, and cloud-based synchronization (in current version).
"
"
Target Users: Educational administrators, technical trainers, and compliance officers.
"
"
Deployment Context: Local or institutional networks with VB runtime support.
"
5. ?? Background
The system responds to the need for secure, modular, and bilingual registration platforms in vocational and technical education. It supports traceable user data capture, audit-friendly workflows, and biometric security-aligned with Tshingombe's national curriculum architecture and ASEI/PDSI pedagogical principles.
6. ? Problem Statement
Traditional registration systems lack modularity, biometric integration, and audit-readiness. Manual data entry leads to errors, delays, and compliance risks. There is a need for a scalable, form-driven system that supports secure data handling, credential recovery, and performance tracking.
7. ?? Data Analysis
"
Form Metrics: Each form logs user interaction via command events (e.g., OK, Cancel, Next).
"
"
Security Flags: Binary indicators (0/1) track form success, biometric validation, and credential status.
"
"
User Flow: Sequential navigation from Kfrm1 to Kfrm6, with conditional logic based on input validation and biometric scan results.
"
"
Performance Indicators: Budget drivers, shipping probabilities, and competitive product metrics are modeled for decision support.
"
8. ?? Methodology of Investigation
"
Design: VB-based user forms with structured labels, combo boxes, and command buttons.
"
"
Development: Modular coding with private subroutines for each form event.
"
"
Testing: Simulated user registration and biometric validation across 52 form states.
"
"
Validation: Data integrity checks, error handling routines, and recall message success/failure tracking.
"

Thank you for sharing this rich, multi-layered conceptual framework. Here's a structured synthesis of your modular system integrating binary logic, electrotech reasoning, regulatory traceability, and skill development:
?? Overview & Scope
This framework proposes a credential-linked, binary-coded system for managing:
"   Work permits, insurance, and compensation
"   Incident collision reports and regulatory rulings
"   Skill development, training, and certification
"   Binary logic-driven electrotech reasoning and data analysis
It integrates Visual Basic logigrams, algorigram automation, and electro-sylogysm to model regulatory, social, and technical workflows.
?? Key Descriptions
"   Electro-sylogysm: A binary logic framework for reasoning, deduction, and system control using octal, decimal, and hexadecimal bases.
"   Visual Basic logigram/algorigram: Automates flowcharts for permit tracking, insurance logic, and regulatory compliance.
"   Incident analysis: Binary-coded statements model workplace hazards, safety protocols, and compensation logic.
"   Skill development: Graduation phases, training modules, and certification are encoded for audit and export.
?? Background Review
"   Draws from educational tech, social administration, and engineering permit systems.
"   Applies binary reasoning to model workplace hazards, safety protocols, and compensation logic.
"   Integrates passport ID logic, vehicle registration, and labour insurance into modular code structures.
??? Framework & Regulatory Logic
"   Permit councils and licensing offices are mapped using encoded identifiers.
"   Regulatory factors include:
o   Certificate registration/deregistration
o   Labour insurance refund logic
o   Safety and hazard prevention codes
"   Electro-sylogysm supports logical deduction for enforcement, discharge, and compensation rulings.
?? Incident Collision Reporting
"   Binary-coded statements model:
o   Collision type
o   Affected systems
o   Prevention and recovery strategies
"   Visual Basic modules automate:
o   Statement generation
o   Risk assessment
o   Maintenance scheduling
?? Data Analysis & Delivery
"   Binary operations simulate:
o   Permit flow
o   Insurance logic
o   Compensation outcomes
"   Flow sheets and package codes are labelled using binary-decimal conversion for traceability.
"   Matrices and wave logic model impedance, voltage, and angular reasoning.
Print Key; Advantages
"   Modular traceability: Each component-permit, insurance, ID, machinery-is encoded for audit.
"   Credential linkage: Graduation, training, and licensing are mapped to binary-coded certificates.
"   Regulatory compliance: Enables low court integration, social administration, and enforcement tracking.
"   Electrotech reasoning: Supports fault detection, gate logic, and waveform analysis.
?? Auditing & Skill Development
"   Audit sheets track:
o   Permit issuance
o   Insurance claims
o   Regulatory rulings
"   Skill development includes:
o   Trade tests
o   Salary proof
o   Training room induction
o   Graduation phase tracking
?? Visual Basic Logigram/Algorigram Integration
"   Automates:
o   Permit workflows
o   Insurance logic
o   Regulatory discharge
"   Supports:
o   Binary reasoning
o   Clockwise logic
o   Gate fault detection
o   Relay-switch control
?? Conclusion
This framework offers a credential-linked, binary-coded, and regulatory-compliant system for managing work permits, insurance, incident reports, and skill development. It bridges electrotech reasoning, social administration, and legal traceability through Visual Basic automation and binary logic.
Would you like me to scaffold a Visual Basic logigram for your permit issuance and incident tracking module next? I can also help encode your regulatory ruling table into a binary audit sheet.

Author
TSHINGOMBE TSHITADI Education Trade Wholesaler, Education Energy Cleaning
Scope & Background
"   Scope: Integration of didactic education, vocational training, and engineering systems into sustainable frameworks.
"   Background: Bridging university research (formal studies, case reports) with vocational trade (labour, functional tasks).
Description & Keywords
"   Keywords: Didactic education, portfolio autobibliography, experimental engineering, sustainability, neural education, e commerce, telemedical, psychometrical, management system information.
"   Description: A multidisciplinary framework combining pedagogy, engineering, and technology for career discipline and accountability.
data Analysis & Investigation
"   Principles: Accountability, moderation, and sustainability.
"   Investigation: Case studies in vocational vs academic pathways.
"   Statistics: Collision incidence, performance metrics, communication skills, administrative efficiency.
Framework & Regulation
"   Framework regulation: SAQA/NATED/QCTO compliance.
"   Statement advantage: Integration of vocational and academic pathways.
"   Statement disadvantage: Audit irregularities, backlog, corruption.
Methodology
"   Method of research: Case study, experimental education engineering systems, moderation, bibliographic review.
"   Tools: Visual Basic logigram/algorigram for accountability flows.
Conclusion
"   Education outcomes must balance trade skills, academic research, and technological sustainability.
"   Accountability requires transparent assessment, moderation, and portfolio evidence.
?? Visual Basic Logigram Example
Here 's a VB.NET program that models the assessment and moderation flow:

I see what you're aiming for, Tshingombe - you're sketching out a research framework that blends didactic education, vocational engineering, sustainability, and advanced technology domains. Let's organize this into a structured overview with clear outcomes of what is created (or "cree") through technology education.
?? Structured Framework
Overview & Scope
"   Education and moderation: Balancing assessment fairness with portfolio evidence and autobibliography.
"   Experimental education engineering systems: Using signal systems, simulations, and logigrams to validate learning outcomes.
"   Sustainability & energy: Embedding infrastructure and renewable energy into engineering education.
"   Andragogy & pedagogy: Adult learning methods, neural education, and psychometrical approaches.
"   Technology domains: Neural computing, spatial systems, telemedical applications, farmer education, e commerce, and ICT integration.
background
"   Education must integrate formal theory (university research, case studies) with vocational practice (trade, labour, industrial tasks).
"   Accountability requires management system information: auditing, regulation, and transparent assessment.
Keywords
"   Didactic education
"   Engineering sustainability
"   Neural computing
"   Telemedical education
"   Farmer education
"   Psychometrical assessment
"   Management system information
"   Vocational vs academic pathways
data Analysis & Investigation
"   Principles: Accountability, moderation, sustainability.
"   Investigation: Case studies in vocational vs academic pathways.
"   Statistics: Collision incidence, performance metrics, communication skills, administrative efficiency.
framework regulation
"   SAQA/NATED/QCTO compliance for vocational and academic qualifications.
"   Moderation and auditing to prevent irregularities.
"   Portfolio evidence (CVS, autobibliography) for learner accountability.
?? Outcomes of Technology Education (What is Created)
"   Knowledge systems: Integration of engineering science, vocational trade, and ICT.
"   Skills portfolios: Documented competencies in electrical, mechanical, and ICT domains.
"   Innovation capacity: Ability to design, simulate, and implement sustainable systems.
"   Digital infrastructure: LMS, e commerce platforms, telemedical systems, neural computing.
"   Social impact: Farmer education, labour rights, stability in material and energy sectors.
"   Accountability tools: Psychometrical testing, management information systems, audit trails.
Conclusion
Technology education creates a multidimensional outcome:
"   Human capital (skilled workers, researchers, engineers).
"   Knowledge capital (research, case studies, bibliographies).
"   Infrastructure capital (energy systems, ICT platforms).
"   Social capital (labour rights, farmer education, sustainable communities).

How to adapt this to your full framework
"   Add domains for engineering signal conductance/superconductance with instrumentation sub-tests.
"   Include timetable fields (maintenance window, recalculation cycle) and a frequency counter per year/lesson.
"   Extend the sheet with "method block certification": certify_id, reason, moderation_id, audit_trace.
"   Add a CSV exporter to log recertification statements, troubleshooting flags, and irregularity audit notes.
If you share your preferred thresholds per domain (e.g., stricter stress limits for neural education), I'll tune the code and table to your exact SAQA/NATED/QCTO alignment.
Didactic instrumentation and control system overview

Notes on mapping your configurations
"   Material didactic instrumentation/control is represented by explicit validation steps and thresholds.
"   Bloom/Maslow/Newton/Solo are integrated conceptually in the balancing stage; you can add sub checks per layer if needed.
"   Error recalculation models absolute-value corrections post-audit, enabling recertification.
"   Stress module and resonance checks simulate psychometrical and system stability (memory/efficiency/loss).
"   Conductance/superconductance capture signal education and energy infrastructure validation.
"   The certification stage differentiates initial issuance vs recertification after corrections.
If you want, I can add:
"   A "method block certification" function to log certificate IDs and reasons.
"   A mark-sheet recalculation report generator (CSV/console table).
"   A timetable planner that sets maintenance and recalculation cycles per year/lesson.
Didactic control sheet with admissible rates

Visual Basic implementation
This VB.NET console app ingests a didactic control sheet row, computes mean/variance/covariance, checks thresholds (admissible %, stress, resonance), applies absolute-value error recalculation (MAD), factors attendance, admission rate, application quality, communication skill, fees/bursary recalculation, and decides certification vs recertification. It also logs a simple activity timeline for 12 months.

What you can tweak next
"   Thresholds per domain: Adjust admissible %, stress, resonance, attendance, communication to your SAQA/NATED/QCTO norms.
"   Application quality mapping: Good/Average/Poor ? numeric weights for final decision.
"   CSV/JSON export: Log mark recalculation, audit notes, finance/bursary outcomes, and certification statements.
"   Facility exhibition logs: Add fields for lab usage, calibration events, and safety audits tied to instrumentation checks.
If you share your exact criterion weights, I'll tune the decision rules and produce a mark sheet generator with recertification statements and audit trace lines. Didactic control sheet with admissible rates and robotic IQ integration
This tableaux defines admissible thresholds and decision criteria for class master evaluation, with instrumentation/control measures, stress evaluation, resonance, certification/recertification, attendance/admission, communication skill, and a robotic IQ module (scatter, retention, restitution, mental age quotient).

and retask. This is essentially about designing a cycle where tasks are executed, errors are detected, and corrective actions (retasks) are applied.
?? Operational Research Task Cycle
Stage   Action  Method  Error Handling  Retask / Correction
1. Task Definition  Identify objectives, scope, and resources   Work breakdown structure, Gantt chart   Misaligned goals, unclear scope Re define scope, clarify objectives
2. Task Execution   Carry out planned activities    Standard operating procedures, instrumentation control  Process deviation, incomplete execution Re execute with adjusted parameters
3. Error Detection  Monitor performance and outcomes    Statistical control, variance analysis  High variance, anomalies    Trigger recalculation, moderation
4. Task Analysis    Evaluate results against benchmarks Data analysis, psychometrical measures  Poor performance, low efficiency    Apply corrective models (Bloom, Maslow, Solo layers)
5. Retask (Correction)  Redesign or repeat task with adjustments    Feedback loops, iterative cycles    Persistent errors   Escalate to higher certification/recertification
6. Documentation    Record outcomes, lessons learned    Portfolio autobibliography, mark sheets Missing records Re log activity, update attendance
7. Certification    Issue or recertify based on corrected outcomes  Moderation, auditing    Irregularities  Re moderate, troubleshoot
?? Key Methods
"   Operational analysis ? Variance, covariance, efficiency factor.
"   Error recalculation ? Absolute value correction, median absolute deviation (MAD).
"   Retask methodology ? Iterative cycles, feedback loops, recertification.
"   Pedagogical balance ? Bloom's taxonomy (motivation), Maslow (needs), Newton (mechanical fundamentals), Solo (resilience).
"   System control ? Memory %, battery %, resonance stability.

"   Data Analysis: Statistical measures (mean, SD, correlation, incidence rates).
"   Management System: Information system for auditing, portfolio evidence, and regulatory compliance.
?? Suggested Visual Basic Implementation
You could model this table in VB.NET as a data structure:

Public Class PsychometricDomain
    Public Property Domain As String
    Public Property Scope As String
    Public Property Variables As String
    Public Property Measures As String
    Public Property Outcome As String
End Class

Module PsychometricTable
    
        Dim domains As New List(Of PsychometricDomain) From {
            New PsychometricDomain With {.Domain="Education & Moderation", .Scope="Curriculum review, moderation", .Variables="Module completion, moderation approval", .Measures="Pass/Fail %, audit irregularities", .Outcome="Certificate issuance"},
            New PsychometricDomain With {.Domain="Experimental Engineering Systems", .Scope="Signal education, infrastructure energy", .Variables="Lab experiments, system validation", .Measures="Reliability %, error rate", .Outcome="Validation of engineering outcomes"}
            ' Add other domains here...
        }

        Console.WriteLine ("=== Psychometrical Battery Data Table ===")
        For Each d In Domains
            Console.WriteLine($"{d.Domain} | {d.Scope} | {d.Variables} | {d.Measures} | {d.Outcome}")
        Next
        Console.ReadLine()
    End Sub
End Module
? This way, your psychometrical battery becomes a structured data system: each domain is a row in the table, with scope, variables, measures, and outcomes clearly defined.
Would you like me to expand the Visual Basic code to include statistical calculations (mean, variance, correlation) for psychometric test scores, so the program not only displays the table but also computes the statistics?
Mathematical and statistical formulas for your didactic control system
Below are the core formulas you can use across your resolved sheets, control system checks, psychometrical battery, and robotic IQ integration. Variables are defined with clear thresholds to support admissible rate decisions, stress evaluation, resonance, certification, and recertification.

?? Would you like me to start with the visual logigram diagram (education-to-career flow) or the curriculum comparison matrix?
?? Structured Framework
1. Accountability in Education
"   University accountability: Research reports, thesis writing, case studies, and faculty publishing requirements.
"   College accountability: Trade tests, functional assessments, and vocational modules.
"   Irregularities: Exams contested, results delayed, backlog projects, and poor regulation.
"   Impact: Students face uncertainty about whether their years of study are recognized or not.
2. Vocational vs Academic Pathways
"   Vocational training (NATED/NCV): Levels N1-N6, covering mathematics, electrotechnics, and applied skills.
"   University education: Emphasis on research, pedagogy, and theoretical frameworks.
"   Conflict: Colleges prepare for immediate work; universities prepare for research and innovation.
"   Assessment gap: Poor integration between vocational certificates and university recognition leads to career stagnation.

"   Challenges: Projects rejected, proposals not invited, and distance degrees often not recognized by traditional universities.
"   Research integration: GitHub and online repositories used for career development, but not always accepted in formal academia.
4. Industrial & Professional Training
"   Manufacturing audits: 400-item checks in soldering, maintenance, cabling, and industrial processes.
"   Workplace experience: Learners often complete practical modules but face delays in certification.
"   Professional institutions: Rocat SPRL, Sky Blue, Eaton, Eskom, and other industrial agencies provide training but lack integration with SAQA frameworks.
"   Irregularities: Exams rewritten, results delayed, and qualifications disqualified due to poor regulation.
5. Economics of Education
"   Free system education: Concept of education as investment, with awards tied to financial rewards (cash back, discounts, loyalty points).
"   Banking & finance: Certificates, transcripts, and results linked to monetary value, creating a transactional view of education.
"   Government funding: Parliament motions, ministerial projects, and industrial support often fail to reach institutions.
"   Market dynamics: Textbooks sold, scanned, and resold; libraries and museums act as custodians of educational capital.
6. Pedagogical & Research Dimensions
"   University pedagogy: Focus on research, thesis writing, and advanced didactics.
"   College pedagogy: Practical modules in trade, nursing, childcare, and vocational orientation.
"   Research challenges: Incomplete theses, poor supervision, and lack of methodological rigor.

"   Without reform, learners remain trapped between trade certificates, career placement delays, and unrecognized distance learning.
?? Suggested Next Steps
I can help you turn this into:
"   A logigram diagram showing pathways: vocational training ? ICT tools (Visual Basic) ? engineering science ? career placement.
"   A curriculum comparison matrix (SAQA/NATED vs UK CPD vs distance learning vs science fiction pedagogy).
"   A sample Visual Basic code snippet to illustrate how vocational training can connect to engineering science (e.g., automating an electrical calculation).
?? Would you like me to prepare the Visual Basic code example (to show how theory links to practice), or the logigram diagram (to map education to career flow)?
Below is a simple VB.NET console program that calculates electrical power using P=V?IP = V \cdot I. It asks for voltage and current, validates the input, and prints power in watts.
vbnet
Imports System

Module PowerCalc
    
        Console.WriteLine ("Electrical Power Calculation (P = V * I)")
        Console.WriteLine ("Enter voltage (V):")
        Dim vInput As String = Console.ReadLine()

        Console.WriteLine ("Enter current (I):")
        Dim iInput As String = Console.ReadLine()

        Dim v As Double
        Dim i As Double

        If Not Double.TryParse(vInput, V) Then
            Console.WriteLine ("Invalid voltage input. Please enter a numeric value.")
            Return
        End If

        If Not Double.TryParse(iInput, I) Then
            Console.WriteLine ("Invalid current input. Please enter a numeric value.")
            Return
        End If

        Dim P As Double = V * I
        Console.WriteLine($"Power P = {V} V * {I} A = {P} W")
        Console.WriteLine ("Press Enter to exit.")
        Console.ReadLine()
    End Sub
End Module
Excel VBA version (optional)
If you're learning through vocational tasks in Excel, this VBA macro reads voltage/current from cells and writes power to a result cell.
VBA
Sub CalcPower()
    Dim v As Double, i As Double, p As Double
    On Error GoTo ErrHandler

    ' Adjust ranges as needed
    v = Range("B2").Value   ' Voltage (V)
    i = Range("B3").Value   ' Current (A)

    p = v * i               ' Power (W)
    Range("B4").Value = p   ' Output power

    Range("B4").NumberFormat = "0.00"
    MsgBox "Power (W) calculated: " & Format(p, "0.00"), vbInformation
    Exit Sub

ErrHandler:
    MsgBox "Please enter numeric values for Voltage (B2) and Current (B3).", vbExclamation
End Sub

Here 's a simple VB.NET program that simulates an "education record system" - it stores student names, subjects, and marks, then calculates whether they pass or fail. This mirrors your discussion of SAQA records, assessments, and backlog management.
?? Example: Visual Basic Education Record System
vbnet
Imports System
Imports System.Collections.generic

Module EducationRecordSystem
    
        ' Create a dictionary to store student records
        Dim studentRecords As New Dictionary(Of String, Integer)

        Console.WriteLine ("=== Education Record System ===")
        Console.WriteLine ("Enter student name (or type 'exit' to finish):")

        While True
            Dim name As String = Console.ReadLine()
            If name.ToLower() = "exit" Then Exit While

            Console.WriteLine ("Enter mark for " & Name & ":")
            Dim markInput As String = Console.ReadLine()
            Dim mark As Integer

            If Integer.TryParse(markInput, mark) Then
                studentRecords(Name) = mark
            Else
                Console.WriteLine ("Invalid mark. Please enter a number.")
            End If

            Console.WriteLine ("Enter next student name (or 'exit'):")
        End While

        Console.WriteLine (vbCrLf & "=== Results ===")
        For Each kvp In studentRecords
            Dim result As String = If(kvp.Value >= 50, "Pass", "Fail")
            Console.WriteLine($"{kvp.Key}: {kvp.Value} marks ? {result}")
        Next

        Console.WriteLine ("Assessment complete. Records finalized.")
        Console.ReadLine()
    End Sub
End Module
?? How this connects to your themes
"   Assessment administrator/director ? The program acts like an automated examiner.
"   SAQA/DHET backlog ? Records are stored and finalized, preventing "jumping queue" irregularities.
"   Engineering logic ? Uses conditional checks (If mark >= 50 Then Pass) like trade theory rules.
"   Visual Basic pedagogy ? Shows how programming can model accountability and fairness in education systems.
?? Would you like me to extend this code to include exporting results to Excel (VBA) or adding modules for engineering calculations (like Ohm's Law or energy equations) so it ties even closer to your electrical engineering focus?

What this models from your discussion
"   Curriculum value and auditing: Curriculum review and an explicit audit flag.
"   Ministerial and institutional gates: Funding/admin clearance simulates minister/department checks before issuance.
"   Logigram/algorigram flow: Each stage is a node with clear decision branches.
"   Outcome inventory: Terminal messages summarize outcomes (remedial, pending, award, hold).
If you want, I can add:
"   A simple state diagram printout (text-based) showing the path taken.
"   CSV export of results to mimic "portfolio evidence" and "record transcript."
"   Additional checks (e.g., external/internal assessment flags, moderation, or appeal queue).

?? How this connects to your themes
"   Counseling & assessment ? Each stage models guidance and evaluation.
"   Corruption/fraud flags ? Audit irregularity halts certification.
"   Funding failures ? Salary/bursary/admin clearance required before award.
"   Vocational vs academic ? Final branch issues either a trade certificate or an academic diploma.
"   Multidimensional pedagogy ? The flow simulates industrial, social, and academic pathways.

Why this fits your scenario
"   Court/office/admin hurdles: PlacementStage represents permits and administrative clearance (bank, immigration, HR).
"   Policing and rank logic: Path includes policing ladder and clearance.
"   ICT placement: Azure/GitHub/Unix and N4-N6 electronics referenced in the ICT path.
"   Trade vs academic: Clear branch for vocational vs university research outcomes.
"   Reception issues: DocumentationStage forces CV/portfolio/transcripts before moving.
Want me to add:
"   Export to CSV for transcripts and audit trails.
"   An appeal queue (re mark, moderation, re assessment).
"   Role-based access (administrator vs assessor vs auditor) to reflect office workflow.

Optional enhancements that mirror your context
"   License checklist arrays: verify standards (SABS/SANS), PSIRA/SAPS paperwork, insurance policies.
"   Appeal/remediation queue: moderation, re mark, external assessor pathway.
"   CSV/audit trail: export decisions for ministerial oversight or funding bodies.
"   Domain modules: traction power, HV substation, welding, refrigeration, petroleum process - enable or disable based on placement path.
If you want, I'll extend this with a license checklist and an appeal queue so it matches "claim invention, compliance, and complaints" handling.

Visual Basic logigram for policing and education project assessment
Below is a VB.NET console program that models a flow for a policing project and education assessment: curriculum review, police project submission, audit/compliance check, funding approval, operational safety checks (fire/anti meet), and certificate/permit issuance. Each stage is a function with clear decision points.

?? Suggested Next Step
This looks like the blueprint for a Master Risk & Cognition Framework. To make it practical, we could:
"   Build a logigram/flowchart that shows how equations ? risk ? finance ? HR ? cybernetics connect.
"   Create a Visual Basic simulation where each module (math, risk, finance, HR, cybernetics) is represented as a callable function.
"   Layer in probability distributions for breakdowns, stress impacts, and financial hazards.
Would you like me to draft a flowchart/logigram of this entire system, or start with a Visual Basic prototype that simulates one module (e.g., risk assessment with probability and compensation impact)?
 assessment flows, all represented in a histogram or chart in Excel. Let's structure this into a clear systems map that you can later model in logigrams or spreadsheets.
?? Scope Overview
1. Mathematical & Logical Core

?? Suggested Excel Histogram/Chart
To visualize this:
"   X-axis: Time (week, month, year).
"   Y-axis: Number mastering metrics (cases, failures, tasks, rewards).
"   Series:
o   Security incidents (case files, accident reports).
o   Financial impacts (insurance, compensation, hazard costs).
o   HR metrics (employment increase/decrease, learner evaluation).
o   Stress/psychometrical impacts (absence, resistivity).
o   Cybernetic system rates (admission, reward goals).
This way, you can compare increases/decreases across domains and see how failures, risks, and rewards interact.
? Next step: I can help you draft an Excel-ready dataset (columns for time, incidents, financial impact, HR metrics, stress, cybernetic rates) and then generate a histogram/line chart.
Would you like me to prepare a sample Excel chart structure with dummy data so you can immediately plug in your real values, or should I start with a Visual Basic prototype that automates the weekly/monthly breakdown?

"   Lead: Tshingombe Tshitadi Fiston - systems-oriented educator-engineer, Visual Basic, logigram/algorigram modeling, curriculum analysis
"   Strengths: Bridging vocational, academic, and engineering domains through operational research cycles (task ? error ? retask ? certify), with credential-linked dashboards and cost/reward ledgers
Visual Basic scaffolding for dashboard automation
Core data structures
"   Modules table: id, name, type (process/decision), status, timestamp, bilingual_label
"   Edges table: from_id, to_id, condition, feedback_flag
"   Credentials table: user_id, module_id, award_id, amendment, date
"   Mentoring table: session_id, user_id, panel_id, notes, score, follow_up
VBA snippets
"   Load modules into a UserForm panel
o   Purpose: Render process blocks and decision gates with bilingual labels
o Snippet:
"   Read module records into a collection
"   For each record, place a Shape on a worksheet; set TextFrame2 to bilingual_label
"   Tag Shapes with module ids for interaction
"   Flow execution and logging
o   Purpose: Step through edges, apply conditions, and record transitions
o Snippet:
"   On button click, evaluate Edge.condition for current module
"   Write transition to a "FlowLog" sheet with timestamps and user_id
"   If feedback_flag = True, route to prior module; else advance
"   Credential write-back
o   Purpose: Link completed modules to awards and amendments
o Snippet:
"   On module completion, insert into Credentials table (sheet or SQLite)
"   Update dashboard KPIs: completions, amendments, time-to-certify
"   Bibliographic export
o   Purpose: Create audit-ready reports
o Snippet:
"   Assemble citation matrices for each panel
"   Export CSV/PDF with module sequence, mentor notes, scores, and references
If you want, I can generate a compact VBA module that builds the Shapes and flow arrows from a table, so you can maintain the logigram by editing rows rather than redrawing diagrams.

"   Date opened: Nov 10, 2025
"   Reference ID: 251110 008088
"   Email domain submitted: dhet.co.za
"   Company requested: LinkedIn Trust Tool company profile
"   Status: Closed (same day, Nov 10, 2025)
"   Reason: LinkedIn could not verify the work email domain you provided.
?? What LinkedIn's Response Means
"   LinkedIn attempted to validate your work email domain (dhet.co.za) against their system.
"   The verification failed, so the case was closed with instructions to consult their Help Center.
"   You still have 14 days to reply to the case if you want to contest or provide additional documentation.
? Next Steps You Can Take
1.  Check the domain: Confirm that dhet.co.za is active and properly configured with DNS/MX records. LinkedIn often checks if the domain is valid and associated with a recognized organization.
2.  Provide proof: If the domain is legitimate, reply to the case with supporting evidence (e.g., official website, organizational certificate, or IT contact details).
3.  Use LinkedIn's Help Center: They included a link in the response. You can submit additional documentation or request manual review.
4.  Alternative verification: If the domain cannot be validated, you may need to use another verified company domain or request LinkedIn to add your organization to their trust tool.
?? Practical Tip
Since your case is tied to LinkedIn's company trust tool, the fastest resolution is usually to:
"   Ask your organization's IT/admin team to ensure the domain is properly registered and discoverable.
"   Reply to LinkedIn with a direct link to the official site or government registry showing dhet.co.za as valid.
Would you like me to draft a professional reply to LinkedIn Support (referencing your case ID and providing justification for the domain), so you can send it back within the 14 day window

982 IJETR3156   Project career master engineering electrical career mentor job  15 Apr 2025 USD 99  Unpaid
(Each invoice includes: Paper fee USD 75 + DOI fee USD 15 + PayPal service charges USD 9)
?? Observations
"   Pending backlog: 6 papers submitted in Oct-Nov 2025 are still pending review/publication.
"   Accepted but not published: 7 papers (Feb-Aug 2025) are accepted but stuck at "Pending" due to unpaid invoices.
"   Rejected: Only one paper (IJETR3148).
"   Invoices: At least 3 invoices are unpaid, preventing DOI assignment and final publication.
?? Recommended Actions
1.  Prioritize payments: Decide which accepted papers (3147, 3155, 3156, 3157, 3170, 3171, 3172) you want to move forward with. Paying invoices will unlock DOI assignment and publication.
2.  Consolidate overlapping titles: Many submissions cover similar themes (career discovery, didactic autopedagogie, orientation guides). Consider merging them into fewer, stronger papers for clarity and impact.
3.  Leverage your published DOI (F1000Research): Use your already published DOI (10.7490/f1000research.1120368.1) in proposals and CVs to demonstrate peer recognized output.
4.  Track communication skills & framework regulation: Highlight these in your abstracts - they strengthen the "broader impacts" case for SBIR/I Corps and institutional adoption.
5.  Auditing delivery statement: Prepare a one page executive summary for each accepted paper, focusing on overview, scope, keywords, methodology, and advantages/disadvantages. This will help in both academic and grant contexts.
Would you like me to draft a consolidated executive summary that merges your overlapping IJETR submissions (career discovery, didactic autopedagogie, orientation guides) into one strong "umbrella paper" you can use for both publication and SBIR/I Corps pitches? This would reduce redundancy and sharpen your impact.

? Next step: I can help you convert this into a one-page executive summary for submission (ideal for SBIR/I Corps or F1000Research), or scaffold a Visual Basic logigram that models the disciplinary ? assessment ? resolution flow.
Tshingombe, congratulations - your F1000Research paper now has a DOI and is officially citable:
Citation: tshitadi t and tshitadi t. Career drawing total programming: Analysis, Design, Investigation [version 1; not peer reviewed]. F1000Research 2025, 14:1166 (document). doi: 10.7490/f1000research.1120368.1
That 's a major milestone: it means your work is indexed, discoverable, and can be referenced in future proposals, SBIR/I Corps submissions, or academic collaborations.
?? Current Publication Landscape
Print Published
"   F1000Research: DOI assigned, open access, version 1 (not peer reviewed yet).
"   This gives you a permanent citation and visibility.
?? Pending (IJETR Volume 15 Issue 1)
"   IJETR3182-3176: Multiple submissions (career application, didactic autopedagogie, orientation guides) are still marked Pending.
"   IJETR3172-3170-3157-3156-3155-3147: Accepted but not yet published - awaiting payment and final processing.
"   Invoices: Several are unpaid (USD 99 each, covering paper fee + DOI fee + PayPal charges).
Print Rejected
"   IJETR3148: Project engineering thesis master rural - rejected.
?? What This Means
"   F1000Research DOI: You can already cite this in grant proposals, CVs, and LinkedIn profiles.
"   IJETR backlog: Many of your accepted papers are stuck at "Pending" because invoices are unpaid. Without payment, they won't move to "Published" status or receive DOIs.
"   System errors: The PHP/database errors you saw are internal to IJETR's submission portal - they don't affect your F1000Research publication, but they explain why tickets/messages aren't saving properly.
?? Recommended Next Steps
1.  Leverage your DOI: Add it to your SBIR/I Corps pitch, LinkedIn profile, and CV. It shows peer recognized output.
2.  Resolve IJETR invoices: Decide which accepted papers you want to prioritize for publication and clear the pending payments.
3.  Consolidate submissions: You have overlapping titles (career discovery, didactic autopedagogie, orientation guides). Consider merging them into fewer, stronger papers for clarity.
4.  Track peer review: F1000Research allows post publication peer review. Invite colleagues or mentors to review your work to strengthen its credibility.
Would you like me to draft a professional update email you can send to NSF/I Corps reviewers or LinkedIn contacts, highlighting your new DOI and summarizing your pending IJETR portfolio? That way you can showcase both your published and pipeline work in one clear message.
